description: The Romany Rye is a novel by George Borrow, written in 1857. Largely
  thought to be at least partly autobiographical, it follows on from Lavengro (1851).
  The title can be translated from Romany as 'Gipsy Gentleman'. On October 18, 1853,
  Mrs. George Borrow wrote to John Murray (his publisher), and spoke of her husband's
  completing his work - "which he proposes to call The Romany Rye - A Sequel to Lavengro."
  The story itself follows the journey of a learned young man thrown in with Gypsies.
  It is a philosophical adventure story of sorts ...
