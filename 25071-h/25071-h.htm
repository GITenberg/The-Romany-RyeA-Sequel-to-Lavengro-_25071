<h2><!-- page xiii--><a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Romany Rye&rsquo; are
one book, though the former was published in 1851 and the latter
not until 1857.&nbsp; After a slumber of six years the dingle
re-awakes to life, Lavengro&rsquo;s hammer shatters the
stillness, and the blaze of his forge again lights up its
shadows, while all the strange persons of the drama take up their
parts at the point where the curtain had been so abruptly rung
down.&nbsp; The post-chaise overturned in the last chapter of
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is repaired in the first of this sequel,
the Man in Black proceeds with his interrupted disquisition, and
Borrow resumes his cold-blooded courtship of poor Isopel, playing
with her feelings as a cat with a mouse.&nbsp; The dingle episode
is divided equally between the two works; and had not
&lsquo;Glorious John,&rsquo; after a series of peremptory notes
from the author, at last consented to publish &lsquo;The Romany
Rye&rsquo; &lsquo;to oblige Mr. Borrow,&rsquo; we had lost some
of the most delightful scenes of which that enchanted spot was
the theatre.</p>
<p>What part of this narrative is <i>Dichtung </i>and what is
<i>Wahrheit </i>has been a debated question.&nbsp; In his chapter
on pseudo-critics in the appendix to the present book, Borrow
denies that he ever called &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; an
autobiography, or authorized any other person to call it
so.&nbsp; But it had been advertised for some months as,
&lsquo;Lavengro: an Autobiography&rsquo;; while as early as 1843
Borrow writes to Murray that he is engaged upon his life; and as
late <!-- page xiv--><a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>as 1862, in an account of himself
written for Mr. John Longe of Norwich, Borrow says that &lsquo;in
1851 he published &ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo; a work in which he
gives an account of his early life.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is indeed
no doubt that the earlier part of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is, in
the main, a true history of the life and adventures of George
Borrow, however embellished here or there with Borrovian touches;
it is only of the truth of the occurrences just before and after
leaving London that scepticism has been expressed.&nbsp;
Borrow&rsquo;s story, however, is so circumstantial that we
should at least be able to discover whether this part of his
history is credible and consistent.</p>
<p>Plainly, the year when Borrow leaves London is 1825.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Somewhat more than a year before,&rsquo; in March (or
rather April) <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a> of the year of Byron&rsquo;s funeral,
<a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a> he had entered the &lsquo;Big
City,&rsquo; a youth verging on manhood.&nbsp; In his preface to
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; he speaks of the time as embracing
&lsquo;nearly the first quarter of the present century,&rsquo;
and in &lsquo;The Romany Rye&rsquo; refers to having edited the
<i>Newgate Chronicle </i>some months ago. <a
name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a>&nbsp; We know also that his youthful
contributions to literature ceased with his translation of
Klinger&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faustus,&rsquo; published on April 18,
1825.&nbsp; About this time, then, when Borrow was literally
reduced to his last shilling, he describes himself as visiting a
fair in the neighbourhood of London.&nbsp; He refuses a loan of
&pound;50 from Jasper Petulengro, and, returning homewards,
notices in a publisher&rsquo;s window a request for a tale or
novel.&nbsp; Subsisting on bread and water, he writes in a week
the &lsquo;Life of Joseph Sell,&rsquo; for which he receives
&pound;20, and twelve days after attending the fair leaves
London.&nbsp; Passing through Salisbury, he travels northward and
encamps in a dingle, where he is poisoned by his old enemy Mrs.
Herne.&nbsp; Saved by the timely intervention of <!-- page
xv--><a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>a
methodist preacher and his wife, he recovers on the following day
(Sunday), and nine days later accompanies his friends to the
Welsh border.&nbsp; Here he again meets Jasper, returning with
him the greater part of the day&rsquo;s journey, settling in
&lsquo;Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle,&rsquo; where he is visited by his
gypsy friends, four days before the Sunday upon which they all
attend church.</p>
<p>A casual remark of Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s on this occasion
affords a valuable clue to the precise date.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any
news stirring, Mr. Petulengro?&rsquo; said Borrow; &lsquo;have
you heard anything of the great religious movements?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Plenty,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;all the
religious people, more especially the evangelicals, those who go
about distributing tracts, are very angry about the fight between
Gentleman Cooper and White-headed Bob, which they say ought not
to have been permitted to take place; and then they are trying
all they can to prevent the fight between the lion and the dogs,
which they say is a disgrace to a Christian country.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The prize-fight between Baldwin and Cooper was fought on Tuesday,
July 5, 1825, near Maidenhead.&nbsp; The combat between the lion,
Nero, and six dogs took place at Warwick on Tuesday, July 26, and
for months beforehand had been the subject of much discussion in
the London and provincial press. <a name="citation0d"></a><a
href="#footnote0d" class="citation">[0d]</a>&nbsp; The Wednesday,
therefore, when the gypsies visited Borrow in the dingle must
have fallen between these two events&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, must have
been the 6th, 13th, or 20th of July.&nbsp; The fair to the
south-east of London, towards which Borrow was attracted by a
huge concourse of people, all moving in the same direction, is
unmistakably the Greenwich Fair, held on Whit-Monday, May 23,
1825. <a name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page xvi--><a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>He must,
then, have set out after this date, and on a Tuesday, as we
calculate by reckoning backwards from the first Sunday passed
with Peter Williams.&nbsp; The gypsies&rsquo; visit occurred on
the 58th day of his tour, so that he must have left London on
Tuesday, May 24, 1825, since to have started on any later day
would have carried him beyond the date of the lion fight.</p>
<p>From these data we can now construct an exact diary of
Borrow&rsquo;s adventures, from the day on which he left London
to that on which he arrived at the posting-inn on the Great North
Road.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[<i>End of</i>
&lsquo;<i>Lavengro</i>.&rsquo;]</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The last twenty dates
are thus arrived at.&nbsp; There are two references to the lapse
of a fortnight since June 29, which was the date of
Borrow&rsquo;s first visit to the public-house, and of
Belle&rsquo;s first Armenian lesson.&nbsp; &lsquo;In about a
fortnight Belle had hung up 100 Haikan numerals on the hake of
her memory;&rsquo; while the landlord, on the <!-- page xix--><a
name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>occasion
when he suggests a fight between Borrow and Belle, complains that
Hunter calls <i>him </i>an old fool, whereas a fortnight ago it
was <i>he </i>who called Hunter a fool.&nbsp; The date, then, of
this last visit of Borrow&rsquo;s to the public-house must have
been on or about July 13.&nbsp; The defeat of the
landlord&rsquo;s game-cocks has been noised abroad for the past
three days (July 10, 11, 12), and since the landlord had referred
ten days before to the fact that the fight was about to come off
on the following Wednesday, it must have occurred on July
6.&nbsp; &lsquo;One day&rsquo;&mdash;not necessarily the 14th or
15th, but this date is unimportant&mdash;the Man in Black
revisits the dingle, and then follow three uneventful days, on
the last evening of which is the great thunderstorm (July
18).&nbsp; Henceforward the daily record is plain and
straightforward, and definitely fixed by the mention of the
Sunday on which Borrow and the gypsies attend the church of
M&mdash;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[<i>Beginning of</i>
&lsquo;<i>Romany Rye</i>.&rsquo;]</p>
<p>57th day [Tuesday, July 19].&nbsp; Makes linchpin; postillion
departs; evening, Man in Black.</p>

<p>63rd day [Monday, July 25].&nbsp; Landlord in despair;
evening, gypsies prepare for fair.</p>
<p>64th day [Tuesday, July 26].&nbsp; Attends fair with gypsies;
last view of Belle; sees horse.</p>
<p><!-- page xx--><a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>65th day [Wednesday, July 27].&nbsp; Gypsies return from
fair.</p>
<p>66th to 67th day [Thursday, July 28, to Friday, July
29].&nbsp; No Belle.</p>
<p>68th day [Saturday, July 30].&nbsp; Belle&rsquo;s letter;
Borrow sleeps soundly.</p>
<p>69th day [Sunday, July 31].&nbsp; Landlord in luck; horse at
public-house; Petulengro lends Borrow &pound;50.</p>
<p>70th day [Monday, August 1].&nbsp; Buys horse.</p>
<p>71st day [Tuesday, August 2].&nbsp; Leaves dingle; rescues old
man&rsquo;s ass; puts up at small inn on the North Road.</p>
<p>72nd day [Wednesday, August 3].&nbsp; Reaches posting house
[Swan Hotel, Stafford].</p>
<p>So far as we have proceeded the accuracy of this calculation
depends upon two dates only.&nbsp; Can we verify it by
establishing the truth of any of the events recorded by
Borrow?&nbsp; In reply to my enquiry whether the <i>Wolverhampton
Chronicle </i>contains any reference to a thunderstorm occurring
on July 18, Mr. J. Elliot, the city librarian replied by sending
me the following extract from that paper for Wednesday, July 20,
1825:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;On Monday afternoon [<i>i.e.</i>, July 18]
three men who were mowing in a field at the Limes, near
Seabridge, in this county, took shelter under the hedge from a
violent thunderstorm.&nbsp; They had not been long there before
one of them was struck with the electric fluid, causing his
immediate death.&nbsp; The other two men were a short distance
from the ill-fated man above mentioned, and were stunned about an
hour, but not injured further.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Borrow mentions attending a horse and cattle fair, in
company with the gypsies, on the morning of the day when, looking
backward toward the dingle, he saw Isopel Berners for the last
time &lsquo;standing at the mouth, <a name="citation0g"></a><a
href="#footnote0g" class="citation">[0g]</a> the <!-- page
xxi--><a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxi</span>beams of the morning sun shining full on her noble face
and figure.&rsquo;&nbsp; It seems probable that this fair, which
took the party about two hours to reach, was the Tamworth horse
and cattle fair held on July 26.</p>
<p>Again, Borrow tells us that &lsquo;a young moon gave a feeble
light,&rsquo; as he mounted the coach to Amesbury, and on May 24
the moon <i>was </i>in its first quarter. <a
name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a>&nbsp; The planet Jupiter, too, he could
have seen after 10 p.m. on June 3, but his reference to the
position of Ursus Major on the evening of his talk with Ursula is
less satisfactory.&nbsp; &lsquo;On arriving at the mouth of the
dingle, which fronted the east, I perceived,&rsquo; says Borrow,
&lsquo;that Charles&rsquo;s Wain was nearly opposite to it high
above in the heavens, by which I knew that the night was
tolerably well advanced.&rsquo;&nbsp; But on July 24, as I learn,
Charles&rsquo;s Wain was in the N.W., and at midnight or 1 a.m.
lay nearly due north, and as low down in the sky as it could
be.&nbsp; This, however, is perhaps to consider too
closely.&nbsp; Indeed, the general accuracy of this part of
Borrow&rsquo;s story renders it probable that it was expanded
from a brief diary kept at the time.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the dates thus arrived at differ from
those of Borrow&rsquo;s biographer.&nbsp; According to Professor
Knapp, <a name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i"
class="citation">[0i]</a> Borrow visits Greenwich Fair on May 12,
1825, writes &lsquo;Joseph Sell&rsquo; May 13 to 18, and disposes
of the MS. on the 20th; leaves London on the 22nd, reaches
Amesbury on the 23rd; leaves Salisbury May 26, and meets author
(man who touches) May 30.&nbsp; On May 31 he buys
Slingsby&rsquo;s pony, is in dingle June 1, visited by Leonora on
the 5th, and drugged by Mrs. Herne on the 8th.&nbsp; He passes
Sunday, June 12, and the following week with Peter Williams and
his wife, on the 21st he sees <!-- page xxii--><a
name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>them to
the border, turns back with Petulengro and settles in
Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle.&nbsp; His fight with the Flaming Tinman,
Professor Knapp tells us, must have occurred about the end of
June.&nbsp; The Professor&rsquo;s chronology, however, seems to
me derived from a calculation&mdash;not in itself over-exact <a
name="citation0j"></a><a href="#footnote0j"
class="citation">[0j]</a>&mdash;based upon the erroneous idea
that the fair took place on May 12. <a name="citation0k"></a><a
href="#footnote0k" class="citation">[0k]</a>&nbsp; This is
traceable to a statement in Thorpe <a name="citation0l"></a><a
href="#footnote0l" class="citation">[0l]</a> that &lsquo;the fair
lasted as a &ldquo;hog&rdquo; and pleasure fair, and was held on
May 12 and October 11, till 1872&rsquo;; but Thorpe here refers
to a later period, and there is no doubt that in 1825 the
Greenwich Fair was held on Whit-Monday, May 23.</p>
<p>Not the least interesting corollary from this correction is
the discovery that &lsquo;that extraordinary work,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;Life of Joseph Sell,&rsquo; was never written.&nbsp; To me
Borrow&rsquo;s insistent iteration of the bare statement that he
wrote such a book is in itself suspicious, and it <i>is </i>not a
little strange that a work for which &lsquo;during the last few
months (before August, 1825) there has been a prodigious
demand&rsquo;<a name="citation0m"></a><a href="#footnote0m"
class="citation">[0m]</a> should have entirely disappeared from
the face of the earth.&nbsp; The name &lsquo;Sell,&rsquo; which
in some curious fashion seems to carry conviction to Professor
Knapp&rsquo;s mind, <a name="citation0n"></a><a
href="#footnote0n" class="citation">[0n]</a> seems to me a
singularly inauspicious one, especially <!-- page xxiii--><a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>when
coming from a writer who, like Pakomovna, was &lsquo;born not far
from the sign of the gammon,&rsquo; and who boasts in his
appendix of having inserted deliberate misstatements in his books
in order to deceive and mislead his critics. <a
name="citation0o"></a><a href="#footnote0o"
class="citation">[0o]</a>&nbsp; But why should Borrow pretend to
have written this book?&nbsp; Chiefly, I think, to emphasize that
independence of character of which he so frequently boasts, and
which, after his marriage fifteen years later to a well-to-do
widow, he is perhaps a little apt to antedate. <a
name="citation0p"></a><a href="#footnote0p"
class="citation">[0p]</a>&nbsp; However Borrow obtained the money
which enabled him to leave London, it is plain that it was not by
writing &lsquo;Joseph Sell&rsquo; at the time and in the manner
described.&nbsp; If he were in as desperate circumstances as he
represents, he probably accepted Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s offer, <a
name="citation0q"></a><a href="#footnote0q"
class="citation">[0q]</a> unless we are to suppose that he
imitated the methods of Jerry Abershaw, Galloping Dick, or some
of the &lsquo;fraternity of vagabonds&rsquo; whose lives Borrow
had chronicled in his &lsquo;Celebrated Trials.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Borrow&rsquo;s narrative after his arrival at Stafford becomes
<!-- page xxiv--><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span>dull, shadowy, and unconvincing&mdash;a strong
argument against its truth; for while Borrow easily lived the
life romantic, he seems to have lacked the power to imagine
it.&nbsp; He describes himself as accepting a somewhat
nondescript office at the posting-inn on the Great North Road,
where he remains for an undefined but considerable period, and
meets again with Francis Ardrey and the Rev. Mr. Platitude.&nbsp;
On leaving the inn he refuses to accept the landlord&rsquo;s
offer of an honorarium of &pound;10, and sets off with <i>his
</i>horse to Horncastle Fair.&nbsp; He meets with an accident a
day&rsquo;s journey from his destination, which confines him for
eight days in the house of the old man who could read Chinese
crockery, but could not tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp;
Ultimately he reaches Horncastle before the end of the fair,
sells his horse to Jack Dale the jockey, and journeys towards
Norwich, where we part with him at Spalding.</p>
<p>These statements are mutually irreconcilable.&nbsp; Horncastle
Fair was held from August 10 (the Feast of St. Lawrence) to
August 21, and had &lsquo;just begun&rsquo; on the day following
his accident; but, as his journey lasted six days, this leaves no
time at all for his experiences at the inn, where he must have
stopped for some weeks, and apparently a much longer period, as
&lsquo;a kind of overlooker in the stables.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, on
the other hand, we allow even a fortnight for his stop at the
inn, for which &pound;10 would be handsome payment, then he could
not have arrived at Horncastle before the end of the fair.&nbsp;
Which part of his story, if any, are we to accept?</p>
<p>The Stafford story is decidedly weak.&nbsp; Borrow, being no
fool, would not have journeyed north for two days on his road to
Horncastle, nor would Ardrey have taken coach to Stafford <i>en
route </i>for a lion fight at Warwick, which had taken place
several days before.&nbsp; Mr. Platitude&rsquo;s reappearance is
extremely artificial, and the ostler&rsquo;s <!-- page xxv--><a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>tales of
Abershaw and Co. are obviously reminiscences of Borrow&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Celebrated Trials.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the Horncastle story
is weaker still.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;-Lieutenant, <i>so
</i>free and young,&rsquo; is pilloried, because eighteen years
afterwards <i>he </i>did not see <i>his </i>way to make Borrow a
J.P. (Who would?)&nbsp; Murtagh is introduced merely as a lay
figure, upon which to drape an inverted account of Borrow&rsquo;s
own travels at a later period; and that very tedious gentleman,
the tall Hungarian, <i>is </i>a character, Professor Knapp tells
us, whom Borrow met in Hungary or Wallachia in 1884.&nbsp; It is
plain that at this point the whole story has become what Borrow
calls a &lsquo;fakement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But that Borrow <i>did </i>buy a horse with money lent by
Petulengro, and sold it at a profit, we have some reason to
credit.&nbsp; Nearly ten years before Borrow wrote &lsquo;The
Romany Rye,&rsquo; in the second edition of his
&lsquo;Zincali,&rsquo; published in 1843, he quotes a speech of
Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s &lsquo;on the day after <i>mol-divvus</i>,
<a name="citation0r"></a><a href="#footnote0r"
class="citation">[0r]</a> 1842.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am no
<i>hindity mush</i>, <a name="citation0s"></a><a
href="#footnote0s" class="citation">[0s]</a> as you well
know,&rsquo; says Jasper.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose you have not
forgot, how, fifteen years ago, when you made horse-shoes in the
little dingle by the side of the Great North Road, I lent you
fifty <i>cottors</i> <a name="citation0t"></a><a
href="#footnote0t" class="citation">[0t]</a> to purchase the
wonderful trotting cob of the innkeeper with the green Newmarket
coat, which three days later you sold for two
hundred.&rsquo;&nbsp; This earlier version seems more probably
the true one, and since three days would find Borrow in Stafford,
it seems reasonable to conclude that he sold his horse there and
not in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Personally, however, I must confess to
feeling little interest in the fate of the
animal&mdash;Belle&rsquo;s donkey were a dearer object.</p>
<p>Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle might well become the Mecca of true
Borrovians, could we but determine the authentic spot.&nbsp;
Somewhere or other&mdash;who will find it for us?&mdash;in west
<!-- page xxvi--><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

href="#footnote0u" class="citation">[0u]</a> is a little roadside
inn called the Silent Woman; <a name="citation0v"></a><a
href="#footnote0v" class="citation">[0v]</a> a little further to
the east is a milestone on the left hand side, and a few yards
from the milestone the cross-road where Petulengro parted from
Borrow.&nbsp; Ten miles further still is a town, and five miles
from the town the famous dingle.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro describes
it as &lsquo;surprisingly dreary&rsquo;; &lsquo;a deep dingle in
the midst of a large field about which there has been a law-suit
for some years past; the nearest town five miles distant, and
only a few huts and hedge public-houses in the
neighbourhood;&rsquo; <a name="citation0w"></a><a
href="#footnote0w" class="citation">[0w]</a> and Borrow speaks of
it as &lsquo;a deep hollow in the midst of a wide field; the
shelving sides overgrown with trees and bushes, a belt of sallows
surrounding it on the top, and a steep winding path leading down
into the depths.&rsquo; <a name="citation0x"></a><a
href="#footnote0x" class="citation">[0x]</a>&nbsp; It was
surrounded by a copse of thorn bushes, <a
name="citation0y"></a><a href="#footnote0y"
class="citation">[0y]</a> and the mouth of the dingle fronted the
east, <a name="citation0z"></a><a href="#footnote0z"
class="citation">[0z]</a> while the highroad lay too far distant
for the noise of traffic to reach Borrow&rsquo;s ears. <a
name="citation0z1"></a><a href="#footnote0z1"
class="citation">[0z1]</a></p>
<p>Professor Knapp has located the dingle in Monmer Lane,
Willenhall, and a visit to the locality and references to old and
new ordnance surveys support this view.&nbsp; Willenhall lies in
the coal measures of Staffordshire, and the modern development of
its coal and iron industries has transformed the &lsquo;few huts
and hedge public-houses&rsquo; into a thriving town of about
17,000 inhabitants.&nbsp; The name of &lsquo;Mumpers&rsquo;
Dingle&rsquo; did not seem to be locally recognised, and, indeed,
was scornfully repudiated by the oldest inhabitant; but this may
have been merely his revenge for my intrusion just about his
dinner hour.&nbsp; But Monmer Lane, still pronounced and in the
older ordnance surveys written &lsquo;Mumber Lane,&rsquo; is
known to all.&nbsp; At the <!-- page xxvii--><a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>top of
this lane on the east side of the bridge lies the &lsquo;Monmer
Lane Ironworks,&rsquo; which Professor Knapp, a little
carelessly, assumes to have been the site of the dingle; <a
name="citation0z2"></a><a href="#footnote0z2"
class="citation">[0z2]</a> and to the west a large flat, bare,
uncultivated piece of land, Borrow&rsquo;s &lsquo;plain,&rsquo;
cut in two by the Bentley Canal, which runs through it east and
west.&nbsp; A walk of 500 yards along the tow-path brings us to a
small bridge crossing the canal.&nbsp; This is known as
&lsquo;Dingle Bridge,&rsquo; the little hawthorn-girt lane
leading to it is called &lsquo;Dingle Lane,&rsquo; and a field
opposite bears the name of &lsquo;Dingle Piece.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
dingle itself has disappeared, possibly as a consequence of
levelling operations in the construction of the canal, and must
not be hastily identified by the pilgrim with the adjoining
marl-pit, which has been excavated still more recently.&nbsp; But
we can hardly doubt that somewhere hereabouts is the historic
spot where Borrow fought and vanquished the Flaming Tinman, that
here he lived with Miss Berners &lsquo;in an uncertificated
manner,&rsquo; that under an adjoining thorn-bush he held his
astounding conversation with Ursula, and that from here, wearied
of her companion&rsquo;s frigid regard and strange bantering,
poor Isopel turned away with her little donkey-cart and a heavy
heart.</p>
<p>The public-house kept by the landlord in the green Newmarket
coat, who was &lsquo;the wonder and glory of the
neighbourhood,&rsquo; and who had fought and beaten &lsquo;Tom of
Hopton,&rsquo; is still standing, though it is no longer used as
an inn, and the pious Borrovian must abandon any hopes he may
have cherished of drinking to the Lavengro&rsquo;s memory in
&lsquo;hard old ale.&rsquo;&nbsp; A quaint old &lsquo;half-way
house,&rsquo; it lies, as Borrow describes, about two miles east
<!-- page xxviii--><a name="pagexxviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>of the dingle&mdash;he saw the
setting sun as he returned from his frequent visits
there&mdash;on the right-hand side of the highroad to Walsall,
along which the brewer proposed to establish &lsquo;a stage-coach
and three to run across the country&rsquo;, and a little nearer
Willenhall, on the north side of the road, is Bentley Hall, the
&lsquo;hall&rsquo; from which the postillion must have been
returning when overtaken by the thunderstorm.&nbsp; The church
attended by Borrow and his gypsy friends, when Mrs. Petulengro
horrified the sexton by invading the nobleman&rsquo;s vacant pew,
may confidently be identified with Bushbury Church, which has all
the features described by Borrow.&nbsp; It is rather over three
miles&rsquo; distance from the dingle, has a peal of bells, a
chancel entrance, and is surrounded by lofty beech-trees.&nbsp;
The vicar in 1825 was a Mr. Clare, but whether of evangelical
views and a widower with two daughters, the present vicar is
unable to inform me.&nbsp; &lsquo;The clergyman of M&mdash;, as
they call him,&rsquo; probably took his name from Moseley Court
or Moseley Hall, country seats in the parish of Bushbury.</p>
<p>It is as a contribution to philology, Borrow tells us in the
Appendix, that he wishes &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and this book to
be judged.&nbsp; Fortunately for himself, his fame rests upon
surer foundations.&nbsp; A great but careless linguist, Borrow
was assuredly no philologist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hair-erecting&rsquo;
(<i>haarstr&auml;ubend</i>) is the fitting epithet which an
Oriental scholar, Professor Richard Pischel, of Berlin, finds to
describe Borrow&rsquo;s etymologies; while Pott, in quoting from
the &lsquo;Zincali,&rsquo; indicates his horror by notes of
exclamation; or, when Borrow once in a way hits on the right
etymon, confirms the statement with an ironical &lsquo;Ganz
recht!&rsquo;&nbsp; Though Borrow had read Borde, it was reserved
for a Viennese scholar, Dr. Zupitza, to discover that the
specimens of &lsquo;Egipt speche,&rsquo; in our original
Merry-Andrew&rsquo;s &lsquo;Boke of Knowledge,&rsquo; were in
reality good <!-- page xxix--><a name="pagexxix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxix</span>Anglo-Romany.&nbsp; And whatever
may have been Lavengro&rsquo;s vaunted acquaintance with
Armenian, it was apparently insufficient to enable him to
identify any of the Armenian elements in the gypsy language.</p>
<p>Touching Borrow&rsquo;s knowledge of Romani, it must be
confessed that while he has been the means of attracting others
to the study of that interesting tongue, his own command of it
was of the slightest.&nbsp; He never mastered &lsquo;deep&rsquo;
(or inflected) Romani, and even his broken gypsy is a curious
Borrovian variety, distinct from the idiom of the tents.&nbsp; No
gypsy ever uses <i>chal </i>or <i>engro </i>as a separate word,
or talks of the <i>dukkering dook </i>or <i>of penning a
dukkerin</i>.&nbsp; His genders are perversely incorrect, as in
the title of the present book; and his &lsquo;Romano Lavo-Lil:
Word Book of the Romany or English Gypsy Language&rsquo; probably
contains more &lsquo;howlers&rsquo; than any other vocabulary in
the world.&nbsp; He is responsible for the creation of such
ghost-words as <i>asarlas</i>, &lsquo;at all, in no manner&rsquo;
(mistaking <i>helpasar les </i>for <i>help asarlas</i>, pp 18,
110); <i>cappi</i>, &lsquo;booty, gain&rsquo; (<i>to lel
cappi</i>, pp 28, 176 = &lsquo;to get blankets&rsquo;);
<i>ebyok</i>, &lsquo;sea&rsquo; (? the gypsy questioned,
mishearing &lsquo;ebb-eye&rsquo; for &lsquo;ebb-tide&rsquo;);
<i>is</i>, &lsquo;if,&rsquo; p. 51; <i>kokkodus</i>,
&lsquo;uncle&rsquo; (perhaps mistaking some such phrase as
&lsquo;like my <i>koko </i>does&rsquo; for &lsquo;like my
<i>kokkodus</i>&rsquo;); <i>lutherum</i>, &lsquo;sleep&rsquo;;
<i>medisin</i>, &lsquo;measure&rsquo; (perhaps because medicine
is measured out); <i>moskey</i>, &lsquo;a spy&rsquo; (? mistaking
<i>dikamaski </i>for <i>dik</i>! <i>a moskey)</i>; <i>o</i>,
&lsquo;he&rsquo; (mistaking <i>kai jivela </i>for <i>kai jivvel
o</i>, p. 53); <i>pahamengro</i>, &lsquo;turnip&rsquo; (probably
mistaking <i>pusamengro</i>, &lsquo;pitchfork,&rsquo; for the
turnip it was used to uproot); <i>pazorrhus</i>,
&lsquo;indebted&rsquo; = &lsquo;trust us&rsquo;); <i>pios</i>,
&lsquo;drunken as a health&rsquo; (<i>aukko tu</i> [<i>to</i>]
<i>pios</i>, p. 78 = &lsquo;here&rsquo;s fun&rsquo;); <i>sar</i>,
&lsquo;with&rsquo;; <i>sherrafo</i>, &lsquo;religious,
converted,&rsquo; pp. 89, 194 (really &lsquo;chief,
principal,&rsquo; from <i>shero</i>, &lsquo;head&rsquo;);
<i>sicovar</i>, &lsquo;eternally&rsquo; (<i>si covar ajaw</i>, p.
90 = &lsquo;so the thing is&rsquo;); <i>sos</i>,
&lsquo;who&rsquo; (= &lsquo;what&rsquo;s&rsquo;); <i>talleno</i>,
&lsquo;woollen, flannel&rsquo; (mistaking <i>talleno chofa</i>,
p. 93, &lsquo;under-skirt&rsquo; <!-- page xxx--><a
name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>for
&lsquo;flannel petticoat&rsquo;), etc.&nbsp; Perhaps the most
amusing instance of all is the word <i>hinjiri </i>in
&lsquo;Lavengro.&rsquo;&nbsp; When Mrs. Herne hanged herself,
Petulengro says that she &lsquo;had been her own
<i>hinjiri</i>,&rsquo; <a name="citation0z3"></a><a
href="#footnote0z3" class="citation">[0z3]</a> and the word is
explained by Professor Knapp as the feminine of
<i>hinjir&oacute;</i>, &lsquo;executioner,&rsquo; from
<i>djandjir</i>, &lsquo;a chain.&rsquo; <a
name="citation0z4"></a><a href="#footnote0z4"
class="citation">[0z4]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; But there <i>is </i>no
such word as <i>hinjero</i>, and <i>hinjiri </i>is merely the
English &lsquo;injury&rsquo; with a superfluous aspirate.</p>
<p>On the Sunday evening after his conversation with Ursula,
Borrow, moved by his discovery of the original meaning of the
gypsy word <i>patteran</i>, falls into a strange train of
thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;No one at present,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;knew that but myself and Ursula, who had learnt it from
Mrs. Herne, the last, it was said, of the old stock; and then I
thought what strange people the gypsies must have been in the old
time.&nbsp; They were sufficiently strange at present, but they
must have been far stranger of old; they must have been a more
peculiar people&mdash;their language must have been more
perfect&mdash;and they must have had a greater stock of strange
secrets.&nbsp; I almost wished that I had lived some two or three
hundred years ago, that I might have observed these people when
they were yet stranger than at present.&nbsp; I wondered whether
I could have introduced myself to their company at that period,
whether I should have been so fortunate as to meet such a
strange, half-malicious, half good-humoured being as Jasper, who
would have instructed me in the language, then more deserving of
note than at present.&nbsp; What might I not have done with that
language had I known it in its purity?&nbsp; Why, I might have
written books in it!&nbsp; Yet those who spoke it would hardly
have admitted me to their society at that period, when they kept
more to <!-- page xxxi--><a name="pagexxxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxxi</span>themselves.&nbsp; Yet I thought
that I might possibly have gained their confidence, and have
wandered about with them, and learnt their language and all their
strange ways, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;and a sigh rose from
the depth of my breast; for I began to think, &ldquo;Supposing I
had accomplished all this, what would have been the profit of it?
and in what would all this wild gypsy dream have
terminated?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is one of the ironies of fate that Borrow, neither then nor
thirty years later, when he made his pedestrian tour through
Wales, should have known that there was still in that country a
gypsy tribe who <i>had </i>preserved the language of two or three
hundred years ago.&nbsp; He might have met gypsies who had spoken
to that Romani patriarch Abram Wood; he might have told us the
origin of the mysterious Ingrams, for one of whom he was himself
mistaken; <a name="citation0z5"></a><a href="#footnote0z5"
class="citation">[0z5]</a> he might have learned from Black Ellen
some of the three hundred folk-tales with which she is credited;
he might have sat at the feet of that fairy witch Alabina the
<i>Melen&iacute;</i>, or have described &lsquo;Taw&rsquo; as a
girl in her teens.&nbsp; We may sigh for the pictures which the
word-master would have given us of this people, but the sigh is
almost one of relief when we think of the escape of the exquisite
tongue which Borrow would have tortured and defaced, and I, for
one, cannot pretend to regret that the discovery of Welsh Romani
should have fallen instead to the lot of that perfect
scholar-gypsy and gypsy-scholar, <span class="smcap">Francis

<p>It having been frequently stated in print that the book called
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; was got up expressly against the Popish
agitation in the years 1850-51, the author takes this opportunity
of saying that the principal part of that book was written in the
year &rsquo;43, that the whole of it was completed before the
termination of the year &rsquo;46, and that it was in the hands
of the publisher in the year &rsquo;48. <a
name="citation0z6"></a><a href="#footnote0z6"
class="citation">[0z6]</a>&nbsp; And here he cannot forbear
observing, that it was the duty of that publisher to have
rebutted a statement which he knew to be a calumny; and also to
have set the public right on another point dealt with in the
Appendix to the present work, more especially as he was the
proprietor of a review enjoying, however undeservedly, a certain
sale and reputation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;But
take your own part, boy!<br />
For if you don&rsquo;t, no one will take it for you.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo; the author feels that
he has no reason to be ashamed of it.&nbsp; In writing that book
he did his duty, by pointing out to his country-people the
nonsense which, to the greater part of them, is as the breath of
their nostrils, and which, if indulged in, as it <!-- page

will, within a very few years, bring the land which he most loves
beneath a foreign yoke; he does not here allude to the yoke of
Rome.</p>
<p>Instead of being ashamed, has he not rather cause to be proud
of a book which has had the honour of being rancorously abused
and execrated by the very people of whom the country has least
reason to be proud?</p>

1</span>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>THE MAKING OF THE LINCH-PIN&mdash;THE SOUND
SLEEPER&mdash;BREAKFAST&mdash;THE POSTILLION&rsquo;S
DEPARTURE</p>
<p>I awoke at the first break of day, and, leaving the postillion
fast asleep, stepped out of the tent.&nbsp; The dingle was dank
and dripping.&nbsp; I lighted a fire of coals and got my forge in
readiness.&nbsp; I then ascended to the field, where the chaise
was standing as we had left it on the previous evening.&nbsp;
After looking at the cloud-stone near it, now cold, and split
into three pieces, I set about prying narrowly into the condition
of the wheel and axle-tree&mdash;the latter had sustained no
damage of any consequence, and the wheel, as far as I was able to
judge, was sound, being only slightly injured in the box.&nbsp;
The only thing requisite to set the chaise in a travelling
condition appeared to be a linch-pin, which I determined to
make.&nbsp; Going to the companion wheel, I took out the
linch-pin, which I carried down with me to the dingle, to serve
me as a model.</p>
<p>I found Belle by this time dressed, and seated near the forge:
with a slight nod to her like that which a person gives who
happens to see an acquaintance when his mind is occupied with
important business, I forthwith set about my work.&nbsp;
Selecting a piece of iron which I thought would serve my purpose,
I placed it in the fire, and, plying the bellows in a furious
manner, soon made it hot; then seizing it with the tongs, I laid
it on my anvil, and began to beat it with my hammer, according to
the rules of my art.&nbsp; The dingle resounded with my
strokes.&nbsp; Belle sat still, and occasionally smiled, but <!--
page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>suddenly started up, and retreated towards her
encampment, on a spark, which I purposely sent in her direction,
alighting on her knee.&nbsp; I found the making of a linch-pin no
easy matter; it was, however, less difficult than the fabrication
of a pony-shoe; my work, indeed, was much facilitated by my
having another pin to look at.&nbsp; In about three-quarters of
an hour I had succeeded tolerably well, and had produced a
linch-pin which I thought would serve.&nbsp; During all this
time, notwithstanding the noise which I was making, the
postillion never showed his face.&nbsp; His non-appearance at
first alarmed me: I was afraid he might be dead, but, on looking
into the tent, I found him still buried in the soundest
sleep.&nbsp; &lsquo;He must surely be descended from one of the
seven sleepers,&rsquo; said I, as I turned away and resumed my
work.&nbsp; My work finished, I took a little oil, leather, and
sand, and polished the pin as well as I could; then, summoning
Belle, we both went to the chaise, where, with her assistance, I
put on the wheel.&nbsp; The linch-pin which I had made fitted its
place very well, and having replaced the other, I gazed at the
chaise for some time with my heart full of that satisfaction
which results from the consciousness of having achieved a great
action; then, after looking at Belle in the hope of obtaining a
compliment from her lips, which did not come, I returned to the
dingle, without saying a word, followed by her.&nbsp; Belle set
about making preparations for breakfast; and I, taking the
kettle, went and filled it at the spring.&nbsp; Having hung it
over the fire, I went to the tent in which the postillion was
still sleeping, and called upon him to arise.&nbsp; He awoke with
a start, and stared around him at first with the utmost surprise,
not unmixed, I could observe, with a certain degree of
fear.&nbsp; At last, looking in my face, he appeared to recollect
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had quite forgot,&rsquo; said he, as he
got up, &lsquo;where I was, and all that happened
yesterday.&nbsp; However, I remember now the whole
affair&mdash;thunder-storm, thunder-bolt, frightened horses, and
all your kindness.&nbsp; Come, I must see after my coach and
horses.&nbsp; I hope we shall be able to repair the
damage.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The damage is already quite
repaired,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;as you will see, if you come to
the field above.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say
so,&rsquo; said the postillion, coming out of the tent;
&lsquo;well, I am mightily beholden to you.&nbsp; Good morning,
young gentlewoman,&rsquo; said he, addressing Belle, who, having
finished her preparations, <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>was seated near
the fire.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-morning, young man,&rsquo; said
Belle, &lsquo;I suppose you would be glad of some breakfast;
however, you must wait a little, the kettle does not
boil.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come and look at your chaise,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;but tell me how it happened that the noise which I
have been making did not awake you; for three-quarters of an hour
at least I was hammering close at your ear.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
heard you all the time,&rsquo; said the postillion, &lsquo;but
your hammering made me sleep all the sounder; I am used to hear
hammering in my morning sleep.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a forge close
by the room where I sleep when I&rsquo;m at home, at my inn; for
we have all kinds of conveniences at my inn&mdash;forge,
carpenter&rsquo;s shop, and wheelwright&rsquo;s&mdash;so that
when I heard you hammering, I thought, no doubt, that it was the
old noise, and that I was comfortable in my bed at my own
inn.&rsquo;&nbsp; We now ascended to the field, where I showed
the postillion his chaise.&nbsp; He looked at the pin
attentively, rubbed his hands, and gave a loud laugh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is it not well done?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will
do till I get home,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;And that is
all you have to say?&rsquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
that&rsquo;s a good deal,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;considering who
made it.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be offended,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;I shall prize it all the more for its being made by a
gentleman, and no blacksmith; and so will my governor, when I
show it to him.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let it remain where it is,
but will keep it, as a remembrance of you, as long as I
live.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then again rubbed his hands with great
glee, and said, &lsquo;I will now go and see after my horses, and
then to breakfast, partner, if you please.&rsquo;&nbsp; Suddenly,
however, looking at his hands, he said, &lsquo;Before sitting
down to breakfast, I am in the habit of washing my hands and
face: I suppose you could not furnish me with a little soap and
water.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;As much water as you please,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;but if you want soap, I must go and trouble the
young gentlewoman for some.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;By no
means,&rsquo; said the postillion, &lsquo;water will do at a
pinch.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Follow me,&rsquo; said I, and leading
him to the pond of the frogs and newts, I said, &lsquo;this is my
ewer; you are welcome to part of it&mdash;the water is so soft
that it is scarcely necessary to add soap to it;&rsquo; then
lying down on the bank, I plunged my head into the water, then
scrubbed my hands and face, and afterwards wiped them with some
long grass which grew on the margin of the pond.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bravo,&rsquo; said the postillion, &lsquo;I see you know
how to make a shift:&rsquo; he then followed my <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>example,
declared he never felt more refreshed in his life, and, giving a
bound, said, &lsquo;he would go and look after his
horses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We then went to look after the horses, which we found not much
the worse for having spent the night in the open air.&nbsp; My
companion again inserted their heads in the corn-bags, and,
leaving the animals to discuss their corn, returned with me to
the dingle, where we found the kettle boiling.&nbsp; We sat down,
and Belle made tea and did the honours of the meal.&nbsp; The
postillion was in high spirits, ate heartily, and, to
Belle&rsquo;s evident satisfaction, declared that he had never
drank better tea in his life, or indeed any half so good.&nbsp;
Breakfast over, he said that he must now go and harness his
horses, as it was high time for him to return to his inn.&nbsp;
Belle gave him her hand and wished him farewell: the postillion
shook her hand warmly, and was advancing close up to
her&mdash;for what purpose I cannot say&mdash;whereupon Belle,
withdrawing her hand, drew herself up with an air which caused
the postillion to retreat a step or two with an exceedingly
sheepish look.&nbsp; Recovering himself, however, he made a low
bow, and proceeded up the path.&nbsp; I attended him, and helped
to harness his horses and put them to the vehicle; he then shook
me by the hand, and taking the reins and whip mounted to his
seat; ere he drove away he thus addressed me: &lsquo;If ever I
forget your kindness and that of the young woman below, dash my
buttons.&nbsp; If ever either of you should enter my inn you may
depend upon a warm welcome, the best that can be set before you,
and no expense to either, for I will give both of you the best of
characters to the governor, who is the very best fellow upon all
the road.&nbsp; As for your linch-pin, I trust it will serve till
I get home, when I will take it out and keep it in remembrance of
you all the days of my life:&rsquo; then giving the horses a jerk
with his reins, he cracked his whip and drove off.</p>
<p>I returned to the dingle, Belle had removed the breakfast
things, and was busy in her own encampment: nothing occurred,
worthy of being related, for two hours, at the end of which time
Belle departed on a short expedition, and I again found myself
alone in the dingle.</p>

<p>THE MAN IN BLACK&mdash;THE EMPEROR OF
GERMANY&mdash;NEPOTISM&mdash;DONNA
OLYMPIA&mdash;OMNIPOTENCE&mdash;CAMILLO ASTALLI&mdash;THE FIVE
PROPOSITIONS</p>
<p>In the evening I received another visit from the man in
black.&nbsp; I had been taking a stroll in the neighbourhood, and
was sitting in the dingle in rather a listless manner, scarcely
knowing how to employ myself; his coming, therefore, was by no
means disagreeable to me.&nbsp; I produced the hollands and glass
from my tent, where Isopel Berners had requested me to deposit
them, and also some lump sugar, then taking the gotch <a
name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a"
class="citation">[5a]</a> I fetched water from the spring, and,
sitting down, begged the man in black to help himself; he was not
slow in complying with my desire, and prepared for himself a
glass of hollands and water with a lump of sugar in it.&nbsp;
After he had taken two or three sips with evident satisfaction,
I, remembering his chuckling exclamation of &lsquo;Go to Rome for
money,&rsquo; when he last left the dingle, took the liberty,
after a little conversation, of reminding him of it, whereupon,
with a he! he! he! he replied, &lsquo;Your idea was not quite so
original as I supposed.&nbsp; After leaving you the other night I
remembered having read of an Emperor of Germany who conceived the
idea of applying to Rome for money, and actually put it into
practice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Urban the Eighth then occupied the papal chair, of the
family of the Barbarini, <a name="citation5b"></a><a
href="#footnote5b" class="citation">[5b]</a> nicknamed the
Mosche, or Flies, from the circumstance of bees being their
armorial bearing.&nbsp; The Emperor having exhausted all his
money in endeavouring to defend the church against Gustavus
Adolphus, the great King of Sweden, who was bent on its
destruction, applied in his necessity to the Pope for a loan of
money.&nbsp; The Pope, however, and his relations, whose cellars
were at that time full of the money of the church, which they had
been plundering for years, refused to lend him a scudo; whereupon
a pasquinade picture was stuck up at Rome, representing the
church lying on a bed, gashed with dreadful wounds, and beset all
over with <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>flies, which were sucking her, whilst
the Emperor of Germany was kneeling before her with a miserable
face requesting a little money towards carrying on the war
against the heretics, to which the poor church was made to say:
&ldquo;How can I assist you, O my champion, do you not see that
the flies have sucked me to the very bones?&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
story,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;shows that the idea of going to
Rome for money was not quite so original as I imagined the other
night, though utterly preposterous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This affair,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;occurred in what
were called the days of nepotism.&nbsp; Certain Popes, who wished
to make themselves in some degree independent of the cardinals,
surrounded themselves with their nephews, and the rest of their
family, who sucked the church and Christendom as much as they
could, none doing so more effectually than the relations of Urban
the Eighth, at whose death, according to the book called the
&ldquo;Nipotismo di Roma,&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> there were in the
Barbarini family two hundred and twenty-seven governments,
abbeys, and high dignities; and so much hard cash in their
possession that threescore and ten mules were scarcely sufficient
to convey the plunder of one of them to Palestrina.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He added, however, that it was probable that Christendom fared
better whilst the Popes were thus independent, as it was less
sucked, whereas before and after that period, it was sucked by
hundreds instead of tens, by the cardinals and all their
relations, instead of by the Pope and his nephews only.</p>
<p>Then, after drinking rather copiously of his hollands, he said
that it was certainly no bad idea of the Popes to surround
themselves with nephews, on whom they bestowed great church
dignities, as by so doing they were tolerably safe from poison,
whereas a Pope, if abandoned to the cardinals, might at any time
be made away with by them, provided they thought that he lived
too long, or that he seemed disposed to do anything which they
disliked; adding that Ganganelli <a name="citation6b"></a><a
href="#footnote6b" class="citation">[6b]</a> would never have
been poisoned provided he had had nephews about him to take care
of his life, and to see that nothing unholy was put into his
food, or a bustling, stirring brother&rsquo;s wife like Donna
Olympia.&nbsp; He then, with a he! he! he! asked me if I had ever
read the book called the &lsquo;Nipotismo di <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Roma,&rsquo;
and on my replying in the negative, he told me that it was a very
curious and entertaining book, which he occasionally looked at in
an idle hour, and proceeded to relate to me anecdotes out of the
&lsquo;Nipotismo di Roma,&rsquo; about the successor of Urban,
Innocent the Tenth, and Donna Olympia, showing how fond he was of
her, and how she cooked his food, and kept the cardinals away
from it, and how she and her creatures plundered Christendom,
with the sanction of the Pope, until Christendom, becoming
enraged, insisted that he should put her away, which he did for a
time, putting a nephew&mdash;one Camillo Astalli&mdash;in her
place, in which, however, he did not continue long; for the Pope,
conceiving a pique against him, banished him from his sight, and
recalled Donna Olympia, who took care of his food, and plundered
Christendom until Pope Innocent died.</p>
<p>I said that I only wondered that between Pope and cardinals
the whole system of Rome had not long fallen to the ground, and
was told in reply that its not having fallen was the strongest
proof of its vital power, and the absolute necessity for the
existence of the system.&nbsp; That the system, notwithstanding
its occasional disorders, went on.&nbsp; Popes and cardinals
might prey upon its bowels, and sell its interests, but the
system survived.&nbsp; The cutting off of this or that member was
not able to cause Rome any vital loss; for, as soon as she lost a
member, the loss was supplied by her own inherent vitality;
though her Popes had been poisoned by cardinals, and her
cardinals by Popes, and though priests occasionally poisoned
Popes, cardinals and each other, after all that had been and
might be, she had still, and would ever have, her priests,
cardinals, and pope.</p>
<p>Finding the man in black so communicative and reasonable, I
determined to make the best of my opportunity, and learn from him
all I could with respect to the papal system, and told him that
he would particularly oblige me by telling me who the Pope of
Rome was, and received for answer that he was an old man elected
by a majority of cardinals to the papal chair; who, immediately
after his election, became omnipotent and equal to God on
earth.&nbsp; On my begging him not to talk such nonsense, and
asking him how a person could be omnipotent who could not always
preserve himself from poison, even when fenced round by nephews,
or protected by a <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>bustling woman, he, after taking a
long sip of hollands and water, told me that I must not expect
too much from omnipotence.&nbsp; For example, that as it would be
unreasonable to expect that One above could annihilate the
past&mdash;for instance, the Seven Years&rsquo; War, or the
French Revolution&mdash;though anyone who believed in Him would
acknowledge Him to be omnipotent, so would it be unreasonable for
the faithful to expect that the Pope could always guard himself
from poison.&nbsp; Then, after looking at me for a moment
stedfastly and taking another sip, he told me that Popes had
frequently done impossibilities.&nbsp; For example, Innocent the
Tenth had created a nephew; for, not liking particularly any of
his real nephews, he had created the said Camillo Astalli his
nephew; asking me, with a he! he! &lsquo;What but omnipotence
could make a young man nephew to a person to whom he was not in
the slightest degree related?&rsquo;&nbsp; On my observing that
of course no one believed that the young fellow was really the
Pope&rsquo;s nephew, though the Pope might have adopted him as
such, the man in black replied, &lsquo;that the reality of the
nephewship of Camillo Astalli had hitherto never become a point
of faith; let, however, the present Pope, or any other Pope,
proclaim that it is necessary to believe in the reality of the
nephewship of Camillo Astalli, and see whether the faithful would
not believe in it.&nbsp; Who can doubt that,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;seeing that they believe in the reality of the five
propositions of Jansenius?&nbsp; The Jesuits, wishing to ruin the
Jansenists, induced a Pope to declare that such and such damnable
opinions, which they called five propositions, were to be found
in a book written by Jansen, though in reality no such
propositions were to be found there; whereupon the existence of
these propositions became forthwith a point of faith to the
faithful.&nbsp; Do you then think,&rsquo; he demanded,
&lsquo;that there is one of the faithful who would not swallow,
if called upon, the nephewship of Camillo Astalli as easily as
the five propositions of Jansenius?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely,
then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the faithful must be a pretty pack of
simpletons!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the man in black exclaimed,
&lsquo;What! a Protestant, and an infringer of the rights of
faith!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a fellow who would feel himself
insulted if anyone were to ask him how he could believe in the
miraculous conception, calling people simpletons who swallow the
five propositions of Jansenius, and are <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>disposed, if
called upon, to swallow the reality of the nephewship of Camillo
Astalli.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was about to speak when I was interrupted by the arrival of
Belle.&nbsp; After unharnessing her donkey and adjusting her
person a little, she came and sat down by us.&nbsp; In the
meantime I had helped my companion to some more hollands and
water, and had plunged with him into yet deeper discourse.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>NECESSITY OF RELIGION&mdash;THE GREAT INDIAN
ONE&mdash;IMAGE-WORSHIP&mdash;SHAKESPEARE&mdash;THE PAT
ANSWER&mdash;KRISHNA&mdash;AMEN</p>
<p>Having told the man in black that I should like to know all
the truth with regard to the Pope and his system, he assured me
he should be delighted to give me all the information in his
power; that he had come to the dingle, not so much for the sake
of the good cheer which I was in the habit of giving him, as in
the hope of inducing me to enlist under the banners of Rome, and
to fight in her cause; and that he had no doubt that, by speaking
out frankly to me, he ran the best chance of winning me over.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to tell me that the experience of countless
ages had proved the necessity of religion; the necessity, he
would admit, was only for simpletons, but as nine-tenths of the
dwellers upon this earth were simpletons, it would never do for
sensible people to run counter to their folly, but, on the
contrary, it was their wisest course to encourage them in it,
always provided that, by so doing, sensible people could derive
advantage; that the truly sensible people of this world were the
priests, who, without caring a straw for religion for its own
sake, made use of it as a cord by which to draw the simpletons
after them; that there were many religions in this world, all of
which had been turned to excellent account by the priesthood; but
that the one the best adapted for the purposes of priestcraft was
the popish, which, he said, was the oldest in the world and the
best calculated to endure.&nbsp; On my inquiring what he meant by
saying the popish religion was the oldest in the world, whereas
there <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>could be no doubt that the Greek and
Roman religion had existed long before it, to say nothing of the
old Indian religion still in existence and vigour, he said, with
a nod, after taking a sip at his glass, that, between me and him,
the popish religion, that of Greece and Rome, and the old Indian
system were, in reality, one and the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You told me that you intended to be frank,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;but, however frank you may be, I think you are rather
wild.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We priests of Rome,&rsquo; said the man in black,
&lsquo;even those amongst us who do not go much abroad, know a
great deal about church matters, of which you heretics have very
little idea.&nbsp; Those of our brethren of the Propaganda, on
their return home from distant missions, not unfrequently tell us
very strange things relating to our dear mother: for example, our
first missionaries to the East were not slow in discovering and
telling to their brethren that our religion and the great Indian
one were identical, no more difference between them than between
Ram and Rome.&nbsp; Priests, convents, beads, prayers,
processions, fastings, penances, all the same, not forgetting
anchorites, and vermin, he! he!&nbsp; The Pope they found under
the title of the Grand Lama, a sucking child surrounded by an
immense number of priests.&nbsp; Our good brethren, some two
hundred years ago, had a hearty laugh, which their successors
have often re-echoed; they said that helpless suckling and its
priests put them so much in mind of their own old man, surrounded
by his cardinals, he! he!&nbsp; Old age is second
childhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did they find Christ?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They found him too,&rsquo; said the man in black,
&lsquo;that is, they saw His image; He is considered in India as
a pure kind of being, and on that account, perhaps, is kept there
rather in the back-ground, even as He is here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All this is very mysterious to me,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; said the man in black; &lsquo;but
of this I am tolerably sure, and so are most of those of Rome,
that modern Rome had its religion from ancient Rome, which had
its religion from the East.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how?&rsquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was brought about, I believe, by the wanderings of
nations,&rsquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &lsquo;A brother of
the Propaganda, a very learned man, once told me&mdash;I do not
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>mean Mezzofanti, who has not five ideas&mdash;this
brother once told me that all we of the Old World, from Calcutta
to Dublin, are of the same stock, and were originally of the same
language, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All of one religion,&rsquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All of one religion,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;and now follow different modifications of the same
religion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We Christians are not image-worshippers,&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You heretics are not, you mean,&rsquo; said the man in
black; &lsquo;but you will be put down, just as you have always
been, though others may rise up after you; the true religion is
image-worship; people may strive against it, but they will only
work themselves to an oil; how did it fare with that Greek
Emperor, the Iconoclast, what was his name, Leon the
Isaurian?&nbsp; Did not his image-breaking cost him Italy, the
fairest province of his empire, and did not ten fresh images
start up at home for every one which he demolished?&nbsp; Oh! you
little know the craving which the soul sometimes feels after a
good bodily image.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have indeed no conception of it,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;I have an abhorrence of idolatry&mdash;the idea of bowing
before a graven figure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The idea, indeed,&rsquo; said Belle, who had now joined
us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you never bow before that of Shakespeare?&rsquo;
said the man in black, addressing himself to me, after a low bow
to Belle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever did,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;but even suppose I did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose you did,&rsquo; said the man in black:
&lsquo;shame on you, Mr. Hater of Idolatry; why the very
supposition brings you to the ground; you must make figures of
Shakespeare, must you? then why not of St. Antonio, or Ignacio,
or of a greater personage still?&nbsp; I know what you are going
to say,&rsquo; he cried, interrupting me as I was about to
speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t make his image in order to
pay it Divine honours, but only to look at it, and think of
Shakespeare; but this looking at a thing in order to think of a
person is the very basis of idolatry.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works are not sufficient for you; no more are the Bible or the
legend of St. Anthony or St. Ignacio for us, that is for those of
us who believe in them; I tell you, Zingaro, that no religion can
exist long which rejects a good bodily image.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&lsquo;Do you think,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works would not exist without his
image?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; said the man in black, &lsquo;that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s image is looked at more than his works, and
will be looked at, and perhaps adored, when they are
forgotten.&nbsp; I am surprised that they have not been forgotten
long ago; I am no admirer of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how
you will put aside the authority of Moses.&nbsp; If Moses strove
against image-worship, should not his doing so be conclusive as
to the impropriety of the practice; what higher authority can you
have than that of Moses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The practice of the great majority of the human
race,&rsquo; said the man in black, &lsquo;and the recurrence to
image-worship, where image-worship has been abolished.&nbsp; Do
you know that Moses is considered by the Church as no better than
a heretic, and though, for particular reasons, it has been
obliged to adopt his writings, the adoption was merely a sham
one, as it never paid the slightest attention to them?&nbsp; No,
no, the Church was never led by Moses, nor by one mightier than
he, whose doctrine it has equally nullified&mdash;I allude to
Krishna in his second avatar; the Church, it is true, governs in
his name, but not unfrequently gives him the lie, if he happens
to have said anything which it dislikes.&nbsp; Did you never hear
the reply which Padre Paolo Segani made to the French Protestant,
Jean Anthoine Guerin, who had asked him whether it was easier for
Christ to have been mistaken in His Gospel, than for the Pope to
be mistaken in his decrees?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never heard their names before,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The answer was pat,&rsquo; said the man in black,
&lsquo;though he who made it was confessedly the most ignorant
fellow of the very ignorant order to which he belonged, the
Augustine.&nbsp; Christ might err as a man,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;but the Pope can never err, being God.&nbsp; The whole
story is related in the Nipotismo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder you should ever have troubled yourselves with
Christ at all,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was to be done?&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;the power of that name suddenly came over Europe, like the
power of a mighty wind; it was said to have come from Judea, and
from Judea it probably came when it first began to agitate minds
in these parts; but it seems to have <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>been known in
the remote East, more or less for thousands of years
previously.&nbsp; It filled people&rsquo;s minds with madness; it
was followed by books which were never much regarded, as they
contained little of insanity; but the name! what fury that
breathed into people! the books were about peace and gentleness,
but the name was the most horrible of war-cries&mdash;those who
wished to uphold old names at first strove to oppose it, but
their efforts were feeble, and they had no good war-cry; what was
Mars as a war-cry compared with the name of ---?&nbsp; It was
said that they persecuted terribly, but who said so?&nbsp; The
Christians.&nbsp; The Christians could have given them a lesson
in the art of persecution, and eventually did so.&nbsp; None but
Christians have ever been good persecutors; well, the old
religion succumbed, Christianity prevailed, for the ferocious is
sure to prevail over the gentile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you stated a little
time ago that the Popish religion and the ancient Roman are the
same?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In every point but that name, that Krishna and the fury
and love of persecution which it inspired,&rsquo; said the man in
black.&nbsp; &lsquo;A hot blast came from the East, sounding
Krishna; it absolutely maddened people&rsquo;s minds, and the
people would call themselves his children; we will not belong to
Jupiter any longer, we will belong to Krishna; and they did
belong to Krishna, that is in name, but in nothing else; for who
ever cared for Krishna in the Christian world, or who ever
regarded the words attributed to him, or put them in
practice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, we Protestants regard his words, and endeavour to
practise what they enjoin as much as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you reject his image,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;better reject his words than his image: no religion can
exist long which rejects a good bodily image.&nbsp; Why, the very
negro barbarians of High Barbary could give you a lesson on that
point; they have their fetish images, to which they look for help
in their afflictions; they have likewise a high priest, whom they
call&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mumbo Jumbo,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I know all about him
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How came you to know anything about him?&rsquo; said
the man in black, with a look of some surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of us poor Protestant tinkers,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;though we live in dingles, are also acquainted with a
thing or two.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&lsquo;I really believe you are,&rsquo; said the man in
black, staring at me; &lsquo;but, in connection with this Mumbo
Jumbo, I could relate to you a comical story about a fellow, an
English servant, I once met at Rome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be quite unnecessary,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I
would much sooner hear you talk about Krishna, his words and
image.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spoken like a true heretic,&rsquo; said the man in
black; &lsquo;one of the faithful would have placed his image
before his words; for what are all the words in the world
compared with a good bodily image?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe you occasionally quote his words?&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He! he!&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;occasionally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For example,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;upon this rock I
will found my Church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He! he!&rsquo; said the man in black; &lsquo;you must
really become one of us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the
rock to Rome?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None whatever,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;faith can remove mountains, to say nothing of
rocks&mdash;ho! ho!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I cannot imagine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what
advantage you could derive from perverting those words of
Scripture in which the Saviour talks about eating His
body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know, indeed, why we troubled our heads about
the matter at all,&rsquo; said the man in black; &lsquo;but when
you talk about perverting the meaning of the text, you speak
ignorantly, Mr. Tinker.&nbsp; When He whom you call the Saviour
gave His followers the sop and bade them eat it, telling them it
was His body, He delicately alluded to what it was incumbent upon
them to do after His death, namely, to eat His body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do not mean to say that He intended they should
actually eat His body?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you suppose ignorantly,&rsquo; said the man in
black; &lsquo;eating the bodies of the dead was a heathenish
custom, practised by the heirs and legatees of people who left
property, and this custom is alluded to in the text.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what has the New Testament to do with heathen
customs,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;except to destroy them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More than you suppose,&rsquo; said the man in
black.&nbsp; &lsquo;We priests of Rome, who have long lived at
Rome, know much better what the New Testament is made of than the
heretics and their theologians, not forgetting their <!-- page
15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Tinkers, though I confess some of the latter have
occasionally surprised us&mdash;for example, Bunyan.&nbsp; The
New Testament is crowded with allusions to heathen customs, and
with words connected with pagan sorcery.&nbsp; Now, with respect
to words, I would fain have you who pretend to be a philologist,
tell me the meaning of Amen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We of Rome,&rsquo; said the man in black, &lsquo;know
two or three things of which the heretics are quite
ignorant.&nbsp; For example, there are those amongst
us&mdash;those, too, who do not pretend to be
philologists&mdash;who know what &ldquo;amen&rdquo; is, and,
moreover, how we got it.&nbsp; We got it from our ancestors, the
priests of ancient Rome; and they got the word from their
ancestors of the East, the priests of Buddh and
Brahma.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is the meaning of the word?&rsquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;&rsquo; said the man in black,
&lsquo;is a modification of the old Hindoo formula, Omani
batsikhom, by the almost ceaseless repetition of which the
Indians hope to be received finally to the rest or state of
forgetfulness of Buddh or Brahma.&nbsp; A foolish practice, you
will say, but are you heretics much wiser, who are continually
sticking amen to the end of your prayers, little knowing when you
do so that you are consigning yourselves to the repose of
Buddh?&nbsp; Oh, what hearty laughs our missionaries have had
when comparing the eternally sounding Eastern gibberish of Omani
batsikhom, Omani batsikhom, and the Ave Maria and Amen Jesus of
our own idiotical devotees.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have nothing to say about the Ave Marias and Amens of
your superstitious devotees,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I dare say
that they use them nonsensically enough, but in putting amen to
the end of a prayer we merely intend to express, &ldquo;So let it
be.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It means nothing of the kind,&rsquo; said the man in
black, &lsquo;and the Hindoos might just as well put your
national oath at the end of their prayers, as perhaps they will
after a great many thousand years, when English is forgotten, and
only a few words of it remembered by dim tradition without being
understood.&nbsp; How strange if, after the lapse of four
thousand years, the Hindoos should damn themselves to the
blindness so dear to their present masters, even as their masters
at present consign themselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the
Hindoos.&nbsp; But my glass has been empty for a considerable
time, perhaps, <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span

addressing Belle, &lsquo;you will deign to replenish
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall do no such thing,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;you
have drank quite enough, and talked more than enough, and to tell
you the truth, I wish you would leave us alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shame on you, Belle!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;consider the
obligations of hospitality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sick of that word,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;you
are so frequently misusing it.&nbsp; Were this place not
Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle, and consequently as free to the fellow as
ourselves, I would lead him out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray be quiet, Belle,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
had better help yourself,&rsquo; said I, addressing myself to the
man in black; &lsquo;the lady is angry with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for it,&rsquo; said the man in black.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If she is angry with me, I am not so with her, and shall
be always proud to wait upon her; in the meantime I will wait
upon myself.&rsquo;</p>

HERETICS&mdash;OLD FRASER&mdash;WONDERFUL TEXTS&mdash;NO
ARMENIAN</p>
<p>The man in black having helped himself to some more of his
favourite beverage and tasted it, I thus addressed him:
&lsquo;The evening is getting rather advanced, and I can see that
this lady,&rsquo; pointing to Belle, &lsquo;is anxious for her
tea, which she prefers to take cosily and comfortably with me in
the dingle.&nbsp; The place, it is true, is as free to you as to
ourselves, nevertheless, as we are located here by necessity,
whilst you merely come as a visitor, I must take the liberty of
telling you that we shall be glad to be alone as soon as you have
said what you have to say, and have finished the glass of
refreshment at present in your hand.&nbsp; I think you said some
time ago that one of your motives for coming hither was to induce
me to enlist under the banner of Rome.&nbsp; I wish to know
whether that was really the case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Decidedly so,&rsquo; said the man in black; &lsquo;I
come here principally in the hope of enlisting you in our
regiment, <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>in which I have no doubt you could do
us excellent service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you enlist my companion as well?&rsquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We should be only too proud to have her among us,
whether she comes with you or alone,&rsquo; said the man in
black, with a polite bow to Belle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before we give you an answer,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;I would fain know more about you; perhaps you will declare
your name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I will never do,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;no one in England knows it but myself, and I will not
declare it, even in a dingle; as for the rest, <i>Sono un Prete
Cattolico Appostolico</i>&mdash;that is all that many a one of us
can say for himself, and it assuredly means a great
deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will now proceed to business,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You must be aware that we English are generally considered
a self-interested people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And with considerable justice,&rsquo; said the man in
black, drinking.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you are a person of acute
perception, and I will presently make it evident to you that it
would be to your interest to join with us.&nbsp; You are at
present, evidently, in very needy circumstances, and are lost,
not only to yourself, but the world; but should you enlist with
us, I could find you an occupation not only agreeable, but one in
which your talents would have free scope.&nbsp; I would introduce
you in the various grand houses here in England, to which I have
myself admission, as a surprising young gentleman of infinite
learning, who by dint of study has discovered that the Roman is
the only true faith.&nbsp; I tell you confidently that our popish
females would make a saint, nay a God of you; they are fools
enough for anything.&nbsp; There is one person in particular with
whom I should wish to make you acquainted, in the hope that you
would be able to help me to perform good service to the holy
see.&nbsp; He is a gouty old fellow, of some learning, residing
in an old hall near the great western seaport, and is one of the
very few amongst the English Catholics possessing a grain of
sense.&nbsp; I think you could help us to govern him, for he is
not unfrequently disposed to be restive, asks us strange
questions&mdash;occasionally threatens us with his crutch; and
behaves so that we are often afraid that we shall lose him, or
rather, his property, which he has bequeathed to us, and which is
enormous.&nbsp; <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>I am sure that you could help us to
deal with him; sometimes with your humour, sometimes with your
learning, and perhaps occasionally with your fists.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in what manner would you provide for my
companion?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We would place her at once,&rsquo; said the man in
black, &lsquo;in the house of two highly-respectable Catholic
ladies in this neighbourhood, where she would be treated with
every care and consideration till her conversion should be
accomplished in a regular manner; we would then remove her to a
female monastic establishment, where, after undergoing a
year&rsquo;s probation, during which time she would be instructed
in every elegant accomplishment, she should take the veil.&nbsp;
Her advancement would speedily follow, for, with such a face and
figure, she would make a capital lady abbess, especially in
Italy, to which country she would probably be sent; ladies of her
hair and complexion&mdash;to say nothing of her
height&mdash;being a curiosity in the south.&nbsp; With a little
care and management she could soon obtain a vast reputation for
sanctity; and who knows but after her death she might become a
glorified saint&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Sister Maria Theresa, for
that is the name I propose you should bear.&nbsp; Holy Mother
Maria Theresa&mdash;glorified and celestial saint, I have the
honour of drinking to your health,&rsquo; and the man in black
drank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Belle,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what have you to say
to the gentleman&rsquo;s proposal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That if he goes on in this way I will break his glass
against his mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have heard the lady&rsquo;s answer,&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said the man in black, &lsquo;and shall
not press the matter.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help, however,
repeating that she would make a capital lady abbess: she would
keep the nuns in order, I warrant her; no easy matter!&nbsp;
Break the glass against my mouth&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; How she
would send the holy utensils flying at the nuns&rsquo; heads
occasionally, and just the person to wring the nose of Satan
should he venture to appear one night in her cell in the shape of
a handsome black man.&nbsp; No offence, madam, no offence, pray
retain your seat,&rsquo; said he, observing that Belle had
started up; &lsquo;I mean no offence.&nbsp; Well, if you will not
consent to be an abbess, perhaps you will consent to follow this
young Zingaro, and to co-operate with him and us.&nbsp; I am a
priest, madam, and can join you both in <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>an instant,
<i>connubio stabili</i>, as I suppose the knot has not been tied
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your mumping gibberish,&rsquo; said Belle,
&lsquo;and leave the dingle this moment, for though &rsquo;t is
free to every one, you have no right to insult me in
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray be pacified,&rsquo; said I to Belle, getting up,
and placing myself between her and the man in black, &lsquo;he
will presently leave, take my word for it&mdash;there, sit down
again,&rsquo; said I, as I led her to her seat; then, resuming my
own, I said to the man in black: &lsquo;I advise you to leave the
dingle as soon as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should wish to have your answer to my proposal
first,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, here you shall have it: I will not
entertain your proposal; I detest your schemes: they are both
wicked and foolish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wicked,&rsquo; said the man in black, &lsquo;have they
not&mdash;he! he!&mdash;the furtherance of religion in
view?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A religion,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;in which you yourself
do not believe, and which you contemn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether I believe in it or not,&rsquo; said the man in
black, &lsquo;it is adapted for the generality of the human race;
so I will forward it, and advise you to do the same.&nbsp; It was
nearly extirpated in these regions, but it is springing up again,
owing to circumstances.&nbsp; Radicalism is a good friend to us;
all the liberals laud up our system out of hatred to the
Established Church, though our system is ten times less liberal
than the Church of England.&nbsp; Some of them have really come
over to us.&nbsp; I myself confess a baronet who presided over
the first radical meeting ever held in England&mdash;he was an
atheist when he came over to us, in the hope of mortifying his
own Church&mdash;but he is now&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;a real
Catholic devotee&mdash;quite afraid of my threats; I make him
frequently scourge himself before me.&nbsp; Well, Radicalism does
us good service, especially amongst the lower classes, for
Radicalism chiefly flourishes amongst them; for though a baronet
or two may be found amongst the radicals, and perhaps as many
lords&mdash;fellows who have been discarded by their own order
for clownishness, or something they have done&mdash;it
incontestably flourishes best among the lower orders.&nbsp; Then
the love of what is foreign is a great friend to us; this love is
chiefly confined to the middle and upper classes.&nbsp; Some
admire the French, and imitate them; <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>others must
needs be Spaniards, dress themselves up in a zamarra, stick a
cigar in their mouths, and say, &ldquo;Carajo.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Others would pass for Germans; he! he! the idea of any one
wishing to pass for a German! but what has done us more service
than anything else in these regions&mdash;I mean amidst the
middle classes&mdash;has been the novel, the Scotch novel.&nbsp;
The good folks, since they have read the novels, have become
Jacobites; and, because all the Jacobs were Papists, the good
folks must become Papists also, or, at least, papistically
inclined.&nbsp; The very Scotch Presbyterians, since they have
read the novels, are become all but Papists; I speak advisedly,
having lately been amongst them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a trumpery
bit of a half papist sect, called the Scotch Episcopalian Church,
which lay dormant and nearly forgotten for upwards of a hundred
years, which has of late got wonderfully into fashion in
Scotland, because, forsooth, some of the long-haired gentry of
the novels were said to belong to it, such as Montrose and
Dundee; and to this the Presbyterians are going over in throngs,
traducing and vilifying their own forefathers, or denying them
altogether, and calling themselves descendants of&mdash;ho! ho!
ho!&mdash;Scottish Cavaliers!!!&nbsp; I have heard them myself
repeating snatches of Jacobite ditties about &ldquo;Bonnie
Dundee,&rdquo; and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Come, fill up my cup, and fill up my
can,<br />
And saddle my horse, and call up my man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff for you!&nbsp; Not that I object to the
first part of the ditty.&nbsp; It is natural enough that a
Scotchman should cry, &ldquo;Come, fill up my cup!&rdquo; more
especially if he&rsquo;s drinking at another person&rsquo;s
expense&mdash;all Scotchmen being fond of liquor at free cost:
but &ldquo;Saddle his horse!!!&rdquo;&mdash;for what purpose I
would ask?&nbsp; Where is the use of saddling a horse, unless you
can ride him? and where was there ever a Scotchman who could
ride?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you have not a drop of Scotch blood in your
veins,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;otherwise you would never have
uttered that last sentence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rsquo; said the man in
black; &lsquo;you know little of Popery if you imagine that it
cannot extinguish love of country, even in a Scotchman.&nbsp; A
thorough-going Papist&mdash;and who more thorough-going than
myself&mdash;cares nothing for his country; and why should he? he
belongs to a system, and not to a country.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&lsquo;One thing,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;connected with
you, I cannot understand; you call yourself a thorough-going
Papist, yet are continually saying the most pungent things
against Popery, and turning to unbounded ridicule those who show
any inclination to embrace it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rome is a very sensible old body,&rsquo; said the man
in black, &lsquo;and little cares what her children say, provided
they do her bidding.&nbsp; She knows several things, and amongst
others, that no servants work so hard and faithfully as those who
curse their masters at every stroke they do.&nbsp; She was not
fool enough to be angry with the Miquelets of Alba, who renounced
her, and called her &ldquo;puta&rdquo; all the time they were
cutting the throats of the Netherlanders.&nbsp; Now, if she
allowed her faithful soldiers the latitude of renouncing her, and
calling her &ldquo;puta&rdquo; in the market-place, think not she
is so unreasonable as to object to her faithful priests
occasionally calling her &ldquo;puta&rdquo; in the
dingle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;suppose some one were to
tell the world some of the disorderly things which her priests
say in the dingle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He would have the fate of Cassandra,&rsquo; said the
man in black; &lsquo;no one would believe him&mdash;yes, the
priests would: but they would make no sign of belief.&nbsp; They
believe in the Alcoran des Cordeliers <a name="citation21"></a><a
href="#footnote21" class="citation">[21]</a>&mdash;that is, those
who have read it; but they make no sign.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pretty system,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;which
extinguishes love of country and of everything noble, and brings
the minds of its ministers to a parity with those of devils, who
delight in nothing but mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The system,&rsquo; said the man in black, &lsquo;is a
grand one, with unbounded vitality.&nbsp; Compare it with your
Protestantism, and you will see the difference.&nbsp; Popery is
ever at work, whilst Protestantism is supine.&nbsp; A pretty
Church, indeed, the Protestant!&nbsp; Why it can&rsquo;t even
work a miracle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can your Church work miracles?&rsquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was the very question,&rsquo; said the man in
black, &lsquo;which the ancient British clergy asked of Austin
Monk, <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>after they had been fools enough to
acknowledge their own inability.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
pretend to work miracles; do you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! dear
me, yes,&rdquo; said Austin; &ldquo;we find no difficulty in the
matter.&nbsp; We can raise the dead, we can make the blind see;
and to convince you, I will give sight to the blind.&nbsp; Here
is this blind Saxon, whom you cannot cure, but on whose eyes I
will manifest my power, in order to show the difference between
the true and the false Church;&rdquo; and forthwith, with the
assistance of a handkerchief and a little hot water, he opened
the eyes of the barbarian.&nbsp; So we manage matters!&nbsp; A
pretty Church, that old British Church, which could not work
miracles&mdash;quite as helpless as the modern one.&nbsp; The
fools! was birdlime so scarce a thing amongst them?&mdash;and
were the properties of warm water so unknown to them, that they
could not close a pair of eyes and open them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that the
British clergy at that interview with Austin, did not bring
forward a blind Welshman, and ask the monk to operate upon
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clearly,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;that&rsquo;s what they ought to have done; but they were
fools without a single resource.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he took a sip
at his glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But they did not believe in the miracle?&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what did their not believing avail them?&rsquo;
said the man in black.&nbsp; &lsquo;Austin remained master of the
field, and they went away holding their heads down, and muttering
to themselves.&nbsp; What a fine subject for a painting would be
Austin&rsquo;s opening the eyes of the Saxon barbarian, and the
discomfiture of the British clergy!&nbsp; I wonder it has not
been painted!&mdash;he! he!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose your Church still performs miracles
occasionally?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It does,&rsquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
Rev. --- has lately been performing miracles in Ireland,
destroying devils that had got possession of people; he has been
eminently successful.&nbsp; In two instances he not only
destroyed the devils, but the lives of the people
possessed&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Oh! there is so much energy in our
system; we are always at work, whilst Protestantism is
supine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not imagine,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that all
Protestants are supine; some of them appear to be filled with
unbounded zeal.&nbsp; They deal, it is true, not in lying
miracles, but they propagate God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; I remember
only a few months ago, having occasion for a Bible, going to an
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>establishment, <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a> the object of which
was to send Bibles all over the world.&nbsp; The supporters of
that establishment could have no self-interested views; for I was
supplied by them with a noble-sized Bible at a price so small as
to preclude the idea that it could bring any profit to the
vendors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of the man in black slightly fell.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I know the people to whom you allude,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;indeed, unknown to them, I have frequently been to see
them, and observed their ways.&nbsp; I tell you frankly that
there is not a set of people in this kingdom who have caused our
Church so much trouble and uneasiness.&nbsp; I should rather say
that they alone cause us any; for as for the rest, what with
their drowsiness, their plethora, their folly, and their vanity,
they are doing us anything but mischief.&nbsp; These fellows are
a pestilent set of heretics, whom we would gladly see burnt; they
are, with the most untiring perseverance, and in spite of divers
minatory declarations of the holy father, scattering their books
abroad through all Europe, and have caused many people in
Catholic countries to think that hitherto their priesthood have
endeavoured, as much as possible, to keep them blinded.&nbsp;
There is one fellow amongst them for whom we entertain a
particular aversion; a big, burly parson, with the face of a
lion, the voice of a buffalo, and a fist like a
sledge-hammer.&nbsp; The last time I was there, I observed that
his eye was upon me, and I did not like the glance he gave me at
all; I observed him clench his fist, and I took my departure as
fast as I conveniently could.&nbsp; Whether he suspected who I
was, I know not; but I did not like his look at all, and do not
intend to go again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you confess that you
have redoubtable enemies to your plans in these regions, and that
even amongst the ecclesiastics there are some widely different
from those of the plethoric and Platitude schools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is but too true,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;and if the rest of your Church were like them we should
quickly bid adieu to all hope of converting these regions, but we
are thankful to be able to say that such folks are not numerous;
there are, moreover, causes at work quite sufficient to undermine
even their zeal.&nbsp; Their sons return at the <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>vacations,
from Oxford and Cambridge, puppies, full of the nonsense which
they have imbibed from Platitude professors; and this nonsense
they retail at home, where it fails not to make some impression,
whilst the daughters scream&mdash;I beg their
pardons&mdash;warble about Scotland&rsquo;s Montrose, and Bonny
Dundee, and all the Jacobs; so we have no doubt that their
papas&rsquo; zeal about the propagation of such a vulgar book as
the Bible will in a very little time be terribly
diminished.&nbsp; Old Rome will win, so you had better join
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the man in black drained the last drop in his glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;will I become the slave of
Rome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will allow you latitude,&rsquo; said the man in
black; &lsquo;do but serve her, and she will allow you to call
her &ldquo;puta&rdquo; at a decent time and place, her Popes
occasionally call her &ldquo;puta.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Pope has been
known to start from his bed at midnight and rush out into the
corridor, and call out &ldquo;puta&rdquo; three times in a voice
which pierced the Vatican; that Pope was&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alexander the Sixth, I dare say,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;the greatest monster that ever existed, though the
worthiest head which the popish system ever had&mdash;so his
conscience was not always still.&nbsp; I thought it had been
seared with a brand of iron.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not allude to him, but to a much more modern
Pope,&rsquo; said the man in black; &lsquo;it is true he brought
the word, which is Spanish, from Spain, his native country, to
Rome.&nbsp; He was very fond of calling the Church by that name,
and other Popes have taken it up.&nbsp; She will allow you to
call her by it if you belong to her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall call her so,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;without
belonging to her, or asking her permission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will allow you to treat her as such if you belong
to her,&rsquo; said the man in black; &lsquo;there is a chapel in
Rome where there is a wondrously fair statue&mdash;the son of a
cardinal&mdash;I mean his nephew&mdash;once&mdash; Well, she did
not cut off his head, but slightly boxed his cheek and bade him
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read all about that in &ldquo;Keysler&rsquo;s
Travels,&rdquo;&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;do you tell her that I
would not touch her with a pair of tongs, unless to seize her
nose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is fond of lucre,&rsquo; said the man in black;
&lsquo;but does not grudge a faithful priest a little private
perquisite,&rsquo; and he took out a very handsome gold
repeater.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&lsquo;Are you not afraid,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to
flash that watch before the eyes of a poor tinker in a
dingle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not before the eyes of one like you,&rsquo; said the
man in black.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is getting late,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I care not
for perquisites.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you will not join us?&rsquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have had my answer,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I belong to Rome,&rsquo; said the man in black,
&lsquo;why should not you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may be a poor tinker,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but I may
never have undergone what you have.&nbsp; You remember, perhaps,
the fable of the fox who had lost his tail?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man in black winced, but almost immediately recovering
himself, he said, &lsquo;Well, we can do without you, we are sure
of winning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not the part of wise people,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;to make sure of the battle before it is fought;
there&rsquo;s the landlord of the public-house, who made sure
that his cocks would win, yet the cocks lost the main, and the
landlord is little better than a bankrupt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People very different from the landlord,&rsquo; said
the man in black, &lsquo;both in intellect and station, think we
shall surely win; there are clever machinators among us who have
no doubt of our success.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I will set the landlord
aside, and will adduce one who was in every point a very
different person from the landlord, both in understanding and
station, he was very fond of laying schemes, and, indeed, many of
them turned out successful.&nbsp; His last and darling one,
however, miscarried, notwithstanding that by his calculations he
had persuaded himself that there was no possibility of its
failing&mdash;the person that I allude to was old
Fraser&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; said the man in black, giving a start, and
letting his glass fall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Fraser of Lovat,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the prince
of all conspirators and machinators; he made sure of placing the
Pretender on the throne of these realms.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can bring
into the field so many men,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my son-in-law,
Cluny, so many, and likewise my cousin, and my good
friend;&rdquo; then speaking of those on whom the government
reckoned for support he would say, &ldquo;So and so are lukewarm,
this person is ruled by his wife, who is with us, the clergy are
anything but hostile to us, and as for the <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>soldiers and
sailors, half are disaffected to King George, and the rest
cowards.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, when things came to a trial, this
person whom he had calculated upon to join the Pretender did not
stir from his home, another joined the hostile ranks, the
presumed cowards turned out heroes, and those whom he thought
heroes ran away like lusty fellows at Culloden; in a word, he
found himself utterly mistaken, and in nothing more than himself;
he thought he was a hero, and proved himself nothing more than an
old fox; he got up a hollow tree, didn&rsquo;t he, just like a
fox?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;L&rsquo;opere sue non furon leonine,
ma di volpe.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man in black sat silent for a considerable time, and at
length answered, in rather a faltering voice, &lsquo;I was not
prepared for this; you have frequently surprised me by your
knowledge of things, which I should never have expected any
person of your appearance to be acquainted with, but that you
should be aware of my name is a circumstance utterly
incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; I had imagined that no person in
England was acquainted with it; indeed, I don&rsquo;t see how any
person should be, I have revealed it to no one, not being
particularly proud of it.&nbsp; Yes, I acknowledge that my name
is Fraser, and that I am of the blood of that family or clan, of
which the rector of our college once said, that he was firmly of
opinion that every individual member was either rogue or
fool.&nbsp; I was born at Madrid, of pure, <i>oim&egrave;</i>,
Fraser blood.&nbsp; My parents at an early age took me to --- <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a> where they shortly died, not, however,
before they had placed me in the service of a cardinal, with whom
I continued some years, and who, when he had no further occasion
for me, sent me to the college, in the left-hand cloister of
which, as you enter, rest the bones of Sir John D---; <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> there, in studying logic and humane
letters, I lost whatever of humanity I had retained when
discarded by the cardinal.&nbsp; Let me not, however, forget two
points&mdash;I am a Fraser, it is true, but not a Flannagan: I
may bear the vilest name of Britain, but not of Ireland; I was
bred up at the English house, and there is at --- a house for the
education of bog-trotters; I was not bred up at that; beneath the
lowest gulf there is one yet lower; whatever my blood may be it
is at least not Irish; whatever my <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>education may
have been I was not bred at the Irish seminary&mdash;on those
accounts I am thankful&mdash;yes, <i>per dio</i>!&nbsp; I am
thankful.&nbsp; After some years at college&mdash;but why should
I tell you my history, you know it already perfectly well,
probably much better than myself.&nbsp; I am now a missionary
priest labouring in heretic England, like Parsons and Garnet of
old, save and except that, unlike them, I run no danger, for the
times are changed.&nbsp; As I told you before, I shall cleave to
Rome&mdash;I must; <i>no hay remedio</i>, as they say at Madrid,
and I will do my best to further her holy plans&mdash;he!
he!&mdash;but I confess I begin to doubt of their being
successful here&mdash;you put me out; old Fraser of Lovat!&nbsp;
I have heard my father talk of him; he had a gold-headed cane,
with which he once knocked my grandfather down&mdash;he was an
astute one, but, as you say, mistaken, particularly in
himself.&nbsp; I have read his life by Arbuthnot, it is in the
library of our college.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; I shall come no
more to this dingle&mdash;to come would be of no utility; I shall
go and labour elsewhere, though . . . how you came to know my
name, is a fact quite inexplicable&mdash;farewell to you
both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then arose, and without further salutation departed from
the dingle, in which I never saw him again.&nbsp; &lsquo;How in
the name of wonder, came you to know that man&rsquo;s
name?&rsquo; said Belle, after he had been gone some time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, Belle?&nbsp; I knew nothing of the fellow&rsquo;s
name, I assure you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you mentioned his name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I did, it was merely casually, by way of
illustration.&nbsp; I was saying how frequently cunning people
were mistaken in their calculations, and I adduced the case of
old Fraser of Lovat, as one in point; I brought forward his name
because I was well acquainted with his history, from having
compiled and inserted it in a wonderful work, which I edited some
months ago, entitled &ldquo;Newgate Lives and Trials,&rdquo; <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> but without the slightest idea that it
was the name of him who was sitting with us; he, however, thought
that I was aware of his name.&nbsp; Belle!&nbsp; Belle! for a
long time I doubted in the truth of Scripture, owing to certain
conceited discourses which I had heard from certain conceited
individuals, but now I begin to <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>believe
firmly; what wonderful texts there are in Scripture, Belle!&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wicked trembleth
where&mdash;where&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;They were afraid where no fear was; thou hast
put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;I have frequently read it
before the clergyman in the great house of Long Melford.&nbsp;
But if you did not know the man&rsquo;s name, why let him go away
supposing that you did?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if he was fool enough to make such a mistake, I was
not going to undeceive him&mdash;no, no!&nbsp; Let the enemies of
old England make the most of all their blunders and mistakes,
they will have no help from me; but enough of the fellow, Belle,
let us now have tea, and after that&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No Armenian,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;but I want to
ask a question: pray, are all people of that man&rsquo;s name
either rogues or fools?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is impossible for me to say, Belle, this person
being the only one of the name I have ever personally
known.&nbsp; I suppose there are good and bad, clever and
foolish, amongst them, as amongst all large bodies of people;
however, after the tribe had been governed for upwards of thirty
years by such a person as old Fraser, it were no wonder if the
greater part had become either rogues or fools; he was a ruthless
tyrant, Belle, over his own people, and by his cruelty and
rapaciousness must either have stunned them into an apathy
approaching to idiocy, or made them artful knaves in their own
defence.&nbsp; The qualities of parents are generally transmitted
to their descendants&mdash;the progeny of trained pointers are
almost sure to point, even without being taught; if, therefore,
all Frasers are either rogues or fools, as this person seems to
insinuate, it is little to be wondered at, their parents or
grandparents having been in the training-school of old Fraser;
but enough of the old tyrant and his slaves.&nbsp; Belle, prepare
tea this moment or dread my anger.&nbsp; I have not a gold-headed
cane like old Fraser of Lovat, but I have, what some people would
dread much more, an Armenian rune-stick.&rsquo;</p>

29</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>FRESH ARRIVALS&mdash;PITCHING THE TENT&mdash;CERTIFICATED
WIFE&mdash;HIGH-FLYING NOTIONS</p>
<p>On the following morning, as I was about to leave my tent, I
heard the voice of Belle at the door, exclaiming, &lsquo;Sleepest
thou, or wakest thou?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I was never more awake
in my life,&rsquo; said I, going out.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the
matter?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He of the horse-shoe,&rsquo; <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a> said she, &lsquo;Jasper, <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a> of whom I have heard you talk, is
above there on the field with all his people; I went about a
quarter of an hour ago to fill the kettle at the spring, and saw
them arriving.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;have you any objection to asking him and his wife to
breakfast?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You can do as you please,&rsquo;
said she; &lsquo;I have cups enough, and have no objection to
their company.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We are the first occupiers of
the ground,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and being so, should consider
ourselves in the light of hosts, and do our best to practise the
duties of hospitality.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How fond you are of
using that word,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;if you wish to invite
the man and his wife, do so, without more ado; remember, however,
that I have not cups enough, nor, indeed, tea enough, for the
whole company.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon hurrying up the ascent, I
presently found myself outside the dingle.&nbsp; It was, as
usual, a brilliant morning, the dewy blades of the rye-grass
which covered the plain sparkled brightly in the beams of the
sun, which had probably been about two hours above the
horizon.&nbsp; A rather numerous body of my ancient friends and
allies occupied the ground in the vicinity of the mouth of the
dingle.&nbsp; About five yards on the right I perceived Mr.
Petulengro busily employed in erecting his tent; he held in his
hand an iron bar, sharp at the bottom, with a kind of arm
projecting from the top for the purpose of supporting a kettle or
cauldron over the fire, and which is called in the Romanian
language, &lsquo;Kekauviskoe saster.&rsquo; <a
name="citation29c"></a><a href="#footnote29c"
class="citation">[29c]</a>&nbsp; With the sharp end of this Mr.
Petulengro was making holes in the earth at about twenty inches
distance from each other, into which he inserted certain long
rods, with a considerable bend towards the <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>top, which
constituted no less than the timbers of the tent, and the
supporters of the canvas. <a name="citation30a"></a><a
href="#footnote30a" class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; Mrs.
Petulengro and a female with a crutch in her hand, whom I
recognised as Mrs. Chikno, sat near him on the ground, whilst two
or three children, from six to ten years old, who composed the
young family of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro were playing about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here we are, brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, as he
drove the sharp end of the bar into the ground; &lsquo;here we
are, and plenty of us&mdash;Bute dosta Romany chals.&rsquo; <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to see you all,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and
particularly you, madam,&rsquo; said I, making a bow to Mrs.
Petulengro; &lsquo;and you also, madam,&rsquo; taking off my hat
to Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-day to you, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&lsquo;you look as usual, charmingly, and speak so, too; you have
not forgot your manners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not all gold that glitters,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Chikno.&nbsp; &lsquo;However, good-morrow to you, young
rye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not see Tawno,&rsquo; said I, looking around;
&lsquo;where is he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where, indeed!&rsquo; said Mrs. Chikno; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know; he who countenances him in the roving line can
best answer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will be here anon,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&lsquo;he has merely ridden down a by-road to show a farmer a
two-year-old colt, she heard me give him directions, but she
can&rsquo;t be satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, indeed,&rsquo; said Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why not, sister?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I place no confidence in your words, brother;
as I said before, you countenances him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I know nothing of your
private concerns; I am come on an errand.&nbsp; Isopel Berners,
down in the dell there, requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs.
Petulengro&rsquo;s company at breakfast.&nbsp; She will be happy
also to see you, madam,&rsquo; said I, addressing Mrs.
Chikno.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that young female your wife, young man?&rsquo; said
Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My wife?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, young man, your wife, your lawful, certificated
wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;she is not my
wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I will not visit her,&rsquo; said Mrs. Chikno;
&lsquo;I countenance nothing in the roving line.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&lsquo;What do you mean by the roving line?&rsquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I mean by the roving line?&nbsp; Why, by it I
mean such conduct as is not tatcheno. <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a>&nbsp; When ryes and rawnies <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a> lives together in dingles, without
being certificated, I calls such behaviour being tolerably deep
in the roving-line, everything savouring of which I am determined
not to sanctify.&nbsp; I have suffered too much by my own
certificated husband&rsquo;s outbreaks in that line to afford
anything of the kind the slightest shadow of
countenance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hard that people may not live in dingles together
without being suspected of doing wrong,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, interposing;
&lsquo;and, to tell you the truth, I am altogether surprised at
the illiberality of my sister&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; I have often
heard say, that is in good company&mdash;and I have kept good
company in my time&mdash;that suspicion is king&rsquo;s evidence
of a narrow and uncultivated mind, on which account I am
suspicious of nobody, not even of my own husband, whom some
people would think I have a right to be suspicious of, seeing
that on his account I once refused a lord; but ask him whether I
am suspicious of him, and whether I seeks to keep him close tied
to my apron-string; he will tell you nothing of the kind; but
that, on the contrary, I always allows him an agreeable latitude,
permitting him to go where he pleases, and to converse with
anyone to whose manner of speaking he may take a fancy.&nbsp; But
I have had the advantage of keeping good company, and
therefore&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meklis,&rsquo; <a name="citation31c"></a><a
href="#footnote31c" class="citation">[31c]</a> said Mrs. Chikno,
&lsquo;pray drop all that, sister; I believe I have kept as good
company as yourself, and with respect to that offer with which
you frequently fatigue those who keeps company with you, I
believe, after all, it was something in the roving and
uncertificated line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In whatever line it was,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro,
&lsquo;the offer was a good one.&nbsp; The young duke&mdash;for
he was not only a lord, but a duke too&mdash;offered to keep me a
fine carriage, and to make me his second wife; for it is true
that he had another, who was old and stout, though mighty rich,
and highly good-natured, so much so, indeed, that the young lord
assured me that she would <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>have no
manner of objection to the arrangement, more especially if I
would consent to live in the same house with her, being fond of
young and cheerful society.&nbsp; So you see&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Mrs. Chikno, &lsquo;I see what I
before thought, that it was altogether in the uncertificated
line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meklis,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;I use your
own word, madam, which is Romany&mdash;for my own part, I am not
fond of using Romany words, unless I can hope to pass them off
for French, which I cannot in the present company.&nbsp; I
heartily wish that there was no such language, and do my best to
keep it away from my children, lest the frequent use of it should
altogether confirm them in low and vulgar habits.&nbsp; I have
four children, madam, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose by talking of your four children you wish to
check me for having none,&rsquo; said Mrs. Chikno, bursting into
tears; &lsquo;if I have no children, sister, it is no fault of
mine, it is&mdash;but why do I call you sister?&rsquo; said she,
angrily, &lsquo;you are no sister of mine, you are a grasni <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a>&mdash;a regular mare&mdash;a pretty
sister, indeed, ashamed of your own language.&nbsp; I remember
well that by your high-flying notions you drove your own
mother&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will drop it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &lsquo;I
do not wish to raise my voice, and to make myself
ridiculous.&nbsp; Young gentleman,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;pray
present my compliments to Miss Isopel Berners, and inform her
that I am very sorry that I cannot accept her polite
invitation.&nbsp; I am just arrived, and have some slight
domestic matters to see to, amongst others, to wash my
children&rsquo;s faces; but that in the course of the forenoon,
when I have attended to what I have to do, and have dressed
myself, I hope to do myself the honour of paying her a regular
visit, you will tell her that with my compliments.&nbsp; With
respect to my husband he can answer for himself, as I, not being
of a jealous disposition, never interferes with his
matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And tell Miss Berners,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&lsquo;that I shall be happy to wait upon her in company with my
wife as soon as we are regularly settled: at present I have much
on my hands, having not only to pitch my own tent, but this here
jealous woman&rsquo;s, whose husband is absent on my
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Thereupon I returned to the dingle, and, without saying
anything about Mrs. Chikno&rsquo;s observations, communicated to
Isopel the messages of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro.&nbsp; Isopel made
no other reply than by replacing in her coffer two additional
cups and saucers, which, in expectation of company, she had
placed upon the board.&nbsp; The kettle was by this time
boiling.&nbsp; We sat down, and as we breakfasted, I gave Isopel
Berners another lesson in the Armenian language.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>THE PROMISED VISIT&mdash;ROMAN FASHION&mdash;WIZARD AND
WITCH&mdash;CATCHING AT WORDS&mdash;THE TWO
FEMALES&mdash;DRESSING OF HAIR&mdash;THE NEW
ROADS&mdash;BELLE&rsquo;S ALTERED APPEARANCE&mdash;HERSELF
AGAIN</p>
<p>About mid-day Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro came to the dingle to
pay the promised visit.&nbsp; Belle, at the time of their
arrival, was in her tent, but I was at the fire-place, engaged in
hammering part of the outer tire, or defence, which had come off
from one of the wheels of my vehicle.&nbsp; On perceiving them I
forthwith went to receive them.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro was dressed
in Roman <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> fashion, with a somewhat smartly-cut
sporting-coat, the buttons of which were half-crowns&mdash;and a
waistcoat, scarlet and black, the buttons of which were spaded
half-guineas: his breeches were of a stuff half velveteen, half
corduroy, the cords exceedingly broad.&nbsp; He had leggings of
buff cloth, furred at the bottom; and upon his feet were
highlows.&nbsp; Under his left arm was a long, black whalebone
riding-whip, with a red lash, and an immense silver knob.&nbsp;
Upon his head was a hat with a high peak, somewhat of the kind
which the Spaniards call <i>calan&eacute;</i>, so much in favour
with the bravos of Seville and Madrid.&nbsp; Now, when I have
added that Mr. Petulengro had on a very fine white holland shirt,
I think I have described his array.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro&mdash;I
beg pardon for not having spoken of her first&mdash;was also
arrayed very much in the Roman fashion.&nbsp; Her hair, which was
exceedingly black and lustrous, fell in <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>braids on
either side of her head.&nbsp; In her ears were rings, with long
drops of gold.&nbsp; Round her neck was a string of what seemed
very much like very large pearls, somewhat tarnished, however,
and apparently of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here we
are, brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro&mdash;&lsquo;here we
are, come to see you&mdash;wizard and witch, witch and
wizard:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chovahanee, and a
chovahano,<br />
The nav se len is Petulengro.&rdquo;&rsquo; <a
name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&lsquo;you make me ashamed of you with your vulgar ditties.&nbsp;
We are come a visiting now, and everything low should be left
behind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;why bring
what&rsquo;s low to the dingle, which is low enough
already?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, are you a catcher at words?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought that catching at words had been confined to the
pot-house farmers and village witty bodies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All fools,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;catch at
words, and very naturally, as by so doing they hope to prevent
the possibility of rational conversation.&nbsp; Catching at words
confined to pot-house farmers and village witty bodies!&nbsp; No,
nor to Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; Listen for an hour or two to the
discourse of a set they call newspaper editors, and if you
don&rsquo;t go out and eat grass as a dog does when he is sick, I
am no female woman.&nbsp; The young lord whose hand I refused
when I took up with wise Jasper, once brought two of them to my
mother&rsquo;s tan, <a name="citation34b"></a><a
href="#footnote34b" class="citation">[34b]</a> when hankering
after my company: they did nothing but carp at each other&rsquo;s
words, and a pretty hand they made of it.&nbsp; Ill-favoured dogs
they were, and their attempts at what they called wit almost as
unfortunate as their countenances.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;madam, we will drop
all catchings and carpings for the present.&nbsp; Pray take your
seat on this stool, whilst I go and announce to Miss Isopel
Berners your arrival.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I went to Belle&rsquo;s habitation, and informed her
that Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro had paid us a visit of ceremony, and
were awaiting her at the fire-place.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray go and
tell them that I am busy,&rsquo; said Belle, who was engaged with
her needle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not feel disposed to take part in
any such nonsense.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall do no such
thing,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and I insist upon your coming
forthwith, and showing proper courtesy to your visitors.&nbsp; If
you do not their feelings will be hurt, and you are aware that I
cannot bear that people&rsquo;s feelings should be
outraged.&nbsp; Come this moment, or&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Or what?&rsquo; said Belle, half smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
was about to say something in Armenian,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Belle, laying down her work, &lsquo;I
will come.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;your
hair is hanging about your ears, and your dress is in disorder:
you had better stay a minute or two to prepare yourself to appear
before your visitors, who have come in their very best
attire.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;I will
make no alteration in my appearance; you told me to come this
moment, and you shall be obeyed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Belle and I advanced towards our guests.&nbsp; As we drew
nigh Mr. Petulengro took off his hat, and made a profound
obeisance to Belle, whilst Mrs. Petulengro rose from the stool,
and made a profound curtsey.&nbsp; Belle, who had flung her hair
back over her shoulders, returned their salutations by bending
her head, and after slightly glancing at Mr. Petulengro, fixed
her large blue eyes full upon his wife.&nbsp; Both these females
were very handsome&mdash;but how unlike!&nbsp; Belle fair, with
blue eyes and flaxen hair, Mrs. Petulengro with olive complexion,
eyes black, and hair dark&mdash;as dark could be.&nbsp; Belle, in
demeanour calm and proud, the gypsy graceful, but full of
movement and agitation.&nbsp; And then, how different were those
two in stature!&nbsp; The head of the Romany rawnie scarcely
ascended to the breast of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I could see that
Mrs. Petulengro gazed on Belle with unmixed admiration, so did
her husband.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the latter,
&lsquo;one thing I will say, which is, that there is only one on
earth worthy to stand up in front of this she, and that is the
beauty of the world, as far as man flesh is concerned, Tawno
Chikno; what a pity he did not come down!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&lsquo;Tawno Chikno,&rsquo; <a name="citation36a"></a><a
href="#footnote36a" class="citation">[36a]</a> said Mrs.
Petulengro, flaring up; &lsquo;a pretty fellow he to stand up in
front of this gentlewoman, a pity he didn&rsquo;t come, quotha?
not at all, the fellow is a sneak, afraid of his wife.&nbsp; He
stand up against this rawnie! <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a> why the look she
has given me would knock the fellow down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is easier to knock him down with a look than with a
fist,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;that is, if the look
comes from a woman, not that I am disposed to doubt that this
female gentlewoman is able to knock him down either one way or
the other.&nbsp; I have heard of her often enough, and have seen
her once or twice, though not so near as now.&nbsp; Well,
ma&rsquo;am, my wife and I are come to pay our respects to you;
we are both glad to find that you have left off keeping company
with Flaming Bosville, <a name="citation36c"></a><a
href="#footnote36c" class="citation">[36c]</a> and have taken up
with my pal; he is not very handsome, but a
better&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take up with your pal, <a name="citation36d"></a><a
href="#footnote36d" class="citation">[36d]</a> as you call him;
you had better mind what you say,&rsquo; said Isopel Berners,
&lsquo;I take up with nobody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I merely mean taking up your quarters with him,&rsquo;
said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;and I was only about to say a better
fellow-lodger you cannot have, or a more instructive, especially
if you have a desire to be inoculated with tongues, as he calls
them.&nbsp; I wonder whether you and he have had any tongue-work
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you and your wife anything particular to say, if
you have nothing but this kind of conversation I must leave you,
as I am going to make a journey this afternoon, and should be
getting ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must excuse my husband, madam,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro, &lsquo;he is not overburdened with understanding, and
has said but one word of sense since he has been here, which was
that we came to pay our respects to you.&nbsp; We have dressed
ourselves in our best Roman way, in order to do honour to you;
perhaps you do not like it, if so, I am sorry.&nbsp; I have no
French clothes, madam, if I had any, madam, I would have come in
them in order to do you more honour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like to see you much better as you are,&rsquo; said
Belle; <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>&lsquo;people should keep to their
own fashions, and yours is very pretty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you are pleased to think it so, madam, it has
been admired in the great city, it created what they call a
sensation, and some of the great ladies&mdash;the court ladies,
imitated it, else I should not appear in it so often as I am
accustomed, for I am not very fond of what is Roman, having an
imagination that what is Roman is ungenteel; in fact, I once
heard the wife of a rich citizen say that gypsies were vulgar
creatures.&nbsp; I should have taken her saying very much to
heart, but for her improper pronunciation; she could not
pronounce her words, madam, which we gypsies, as they call us,
usually can, so I thought she was no very high purchase.&nbsp;
You are very beautiful, madam, though you are not dressed as I
could wish to see you, and your hair is hanging down in sad
confusion; allow me to assist you in arranging your hair, madam;
I will dress it for you in our fashion; I would fain see how your
hair would look in our poor gypsy fashion: pray allow me,
madam?&rsquo; and she took Belle by the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really can do no such thing,&rsquo; said Belle
withdrawing her hand; &lsquo;I thank you for coming to see me,
but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do allow me to officiate upon your hair, madam,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;I should esteem your allowing me a
great mark of condescension.&nbsp; You are very beautiful, madam,
and I think you doubly so, because you are so fair; I have a
great esteem for persons with fair complexions and hair; I have a
less regard for people with dark hair and complexions,
madam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did you turn off the lord, and take up with
me?&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;that same lord was fair
enough all about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People do when they are young and silly what they
sometimes repent of when they are of riper years and
understandings.&nbsp; I sometimes think that had I not been
something of a simpleton, I might at this time be a great court
lady.&nbsp; Now, madam,&rsquo; said she, again taking Belle by
the hand, &lsquo;do oblige me by allowing me to plait your hair a
little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have really a good mind to be angry with you,&rsquo;
said Belle, giving Mrs. Petulengro a peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do allow her to arrange your hair,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;she means <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>no harm, and wishes to do you honour;
do oblige her and me too, for I should like to see how your hair
would look dressed in her fashion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You hear what the young rye says?&rsquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sure you will oblige the young rye,
if not myself.&nbsp; Many people would be willing to oblige the
young rye, if he would but ask them; but he is not in the habit
of asking favours.&nbsp; He has a nose of his own, which he keeps
tolerably exalted; he does not think small-beer of himself,
madam; and all the time I have been with him, I never heard him
ask a favour before; therefore, madam, I am sure you will oblige
him.&nbsp; My sister Ursula would be very willing to oblige him
in many things, but he will not ask her for anything, except for
such a favour as a word, which is a poor favour after all.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t mean for her word; perhaps he will some day ask you
for your word.&nbsp; If so&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why here you are, after railing at me for catching at
words, catching at a word yourself,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me in my
discourse; if I caught at a word now, I am not in the habit of
doing so.&nbsp; I am no conceited body; no newspaper Neddy; no
pot-house witty person.&nbsp; I was about to say, madam, that if
the young rye asks you at any time for your word, you will do as
you deem convenient; but I am sure you will oblige him by
allowing me to braid your hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not do it to oblige him,&rsquo; said Belle;
&lsquo;the young rye, as you call him, is nothing to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, to oblige me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&lsquo;do allow me to become your poor tire-woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is great nonsense,&rsquo; said Belle, reddening;
&lsquo;however, as you came to see me, and ask the matter as a
particular favour to yourself&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, madam,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, leading
Belle to the stool; &lsquo;please to sit down here.&nbsp; Thank
you; your hair is very beautiful, madam,&rsquo; she continued, as
she proceeded to braid Belle&rsquo;s hair; &lsquo;so is your
countenance.&nbsp; Should you ever go to the great city, among
the grand folks, you would make a sensation, madam.&nbsp; I have
made one myself, who am dark; the chi she is kauley, <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a> which last word signifies black, which
I am not, though rather dark.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no colour like
white, <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>madam; it&rsquo;s so lasting, so
genteel.&nbsp; Gentility will carry the day, madam, even with the
young rye.&nbsp; He will ask words of the black lass, but beg the
word of the fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. Petulengro and myself entered into
conversation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any news stirring, Mr.
Petulengro?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you heard anything
of the great religious movements?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plenty,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;all the
religious people, more especially the Evangelicals&mdash;those
that go about distributing tracts&mdash;are very angry about the
fight between Gentleman Cooper and White-headed Bob, <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a> which they say ought not to have been
permitted to take place; and then they are trying all they can to
prevent the fight between the lion and the dogs, <a
name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a> which they say is a disgrace to a
Christian country.&nbsp; Now, I can&rsquo;t say that I have any
quarrel with the religious party and the Evangelicals; they are
always civil to me and mine, and frequently give us tracts, as
they call them, which neither I nor mine can read; but I cannot
say that I approve of any movements, religious or not, which have
in aim to put down all life and manly sport in this here
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything else?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People are becoming vastly sharp,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro; &lsquo;and I am told that all the old-fashioned,
good-tempered constables are going to be set aside, and a paid
body of men to be established, who are not to permit a tramper or
vagabond on the roads of England;&mdash;and talking of roads,
puts me in mind of a strange story I heard two nights ago, whilst
drinking some beer at a public-house, in company with my cousin
Sylvester.&nbsp; I had asked Tawno to go, but his wife would not
let him.&nbsp; Just opposite me, smoking their pipes, were a
couple of men, something like engineers, and they were talking of
a wonderful invention which was to make a wonderful alteration in
England; inasmuch as it would set aside all the old roads, which
in a little time would be ploughed up, and sowed with corn, and
cause all England to be laid down with iron roads, on which
people would go thundering along in vehicles, pushed forward by
fire and smoke.&nbsp; Now, brother, when I heard this, I did not
feel very comfortable; for I thought to myself, what a queer
place such a road would be to pitch one&rsquo;s tent upon, and
how impossible it would be for one&rsquo;s cattle to find a bite
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>of grass upon it; and I thought likewise of the danger
to which one&rsquo;s family would be exposed of being run over
and severely scorched by these same flying, fiery vehicles; so I
made bold to say, that I hoped such an invention would never be
countenanced, because it was likely to do a great deal of
harm.&nbsp; Whereupon, one of the men, giving me a glance, said,
without taking the pipe out of his mouth, that for his part, he
sincerely hoped that it would take effect; and if it did no other
good than stopping the rambles of gypsies, and other like scamps,
it ought to be encouraged.&nbsp; Well, brother, feeling myself
insulted, I put my hand into my pocket, in order to pull out
money, intending to challenge him to fight for a five-shilling
stake, but merely found sixpence, having left all my other money
at the tent; which sixpence was just sufficient to pay for the
beer which Sylvester and myself were drinking, of whom I
couldn&rsquo;t hope to borrow anything&mdash;&ldquo;poor as
Sylvester&rdquo; being a by-word amongst us.&nbsp; So, not being
able to back myself, I held my peace, and let the Gorgio <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> have it all his own way, who, after
turning up his nose at me, went on discoursing about the said
invention, saying what a fund of profit it would be to those who
knew how to make use of it, and should have the laying down of
the new roads, and the shoeing of England with iron.&nbsp; And
after he had said this, and much more of the same kind, which I
cannot remember, he and his companion got up and walked away; and
presently I and Sylvester got up and walked to our camp; and
there I lay down in my tent by the side of my wife, where I had
an ugly dream of having camped upon an iron road; my tent being
overturned by a flying vehicle; my wife&rsquo;s leg injured; and
all my affairs put into great confusion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, madam,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;I have
braided your hair in our fashion; you look very beautiful, madam;
more beautiful, if possible, than before.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle now
rose, and came forward with her tire-woman.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro
was loud in his applause, but I said nothing, for I did not think
Belle was improved in appearance by having submitted to the
ministry of Mrs. Petulengro&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Nature never
intended Belle to appear as a gypsy; she had made her too proud
and serious.&nbsp; A more proper part for her was that of a
heroine, a queenly heroine&mdash;that of Theresa of Hungary, for
example; or, better <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>still, that of Brynhilda the
Valkyrie, the beloved of Sigurd, the serpent-killer, who incurred
the curse of Odin, because, in the tumult of spears, she sided
with the young king, and doomed the old warrior to die, to whom
Odin had promised victory.</p>
<p>Belle looked at me for a moment in silence, then turning to
Mrs. Petulengro, she said: &lsquo;You have had your will with me;
are you satisfied?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Quite so, madam,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;and I hope you will be so too, as
soon as you have looked in the glass.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
looked in one already,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;and the glass
does not flatter.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You mean the face of the
young rye,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;never mind him,
madam; the young rye, though he knows a thing or two, is not a
university, nor a person of universal wisdom.&nbsp; I assure you
that you never looked so well before, and I hope that, from this
moment, you will wear your hair in this way.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And who is to braid it in this way?&rsquo; said Belle,
smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I, madam,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro,
&lsquo;I will braid it for you every morning, if you will but be
persuaded to join us.&nbsp; Do so, madam, and I think if you did,
the young rye would do so too.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The young rye
is nothing to me, nor I to him,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;we have
stayed some time together, but our paths will soon be
apart.&nbsp; Now farewell, for I am about to take a
journey.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And you will go out with your hair
as I have braided it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &lsquo;if you
do everybody will be in love with you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;hitherto I have allowed you
to do what you please, but henceforth I shall have my own
way.&nbsp; Come, come,&rsquo; said she, observing that the gypsy
was about to speak, &lsquo;we have had enough of nonsense,
whenever I leave this hollow it will be wearing my hair in my own
fashion.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, wife,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, &lsquo;we will no longer intrude upon the rye and
rawnie, there is such a thing as being troublesome.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon Mr. Petulengro and his wife took their leave, with many
salutations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then you are going?&rsquo; said I, when
Belle and I were left alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Belle,
&lsquo;I am going on a journey, my affairs compel
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But you will return again?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;I shall return
once more.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Once more,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;what do you mean by once more?&nbsp; The Petulengros <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> will soon be gone, and will you abandon
me in this place?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You were alone here,&rsquo;
said Belle, &lsquo;before I came, and I suppose, <!-- page
42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>found
it agreeable, or you would not have stayed in it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that was before I knew you; but
having lived with you here, I should be very loth to live here
without you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Belle,
&lsquo;I did not know that I was of so much consequence to
you.&nbsp; Well, the day is wearing away&mdash;I must go and
harness Traveller to the cart.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will do
that,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or anything else you may wish
me.&nbsp; Go and prepare yourself; I will see after Traveller and
the cart.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle departed to her tent, and I set
about performing the task I had undertaken.&nbsp; In about half
an hour Belle again made her appearance&mdash;she was dressed
neatly and plainly.&nbsp; Her hair was no longer in the Roman
fashion, in which Pakomovna had plaited it, but was secured by a
comb; she held a bonnet in her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is there
anything else I can do for you?&rsquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There are two or three bundles by my tent which you can
put into the cart,&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp; I put the bundles
into the cart, and then led Traveller and the cart up the winding
path to the mouth of the dingle, near which was Mr.
Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; Belle followed.&nbsp; At the
top, I delivered the reins into her hands; we looked at each
other steadfastly for some time.&nbsp; Belle then departed, and I
returned to the dingle, where, seating myself on my stone, I
remained for upwards of an hour in thought.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>THE FESTIVAL&mdash;THE GYPSY SONG&mdash;PIRAMUS OF
ROME&mdash;THE SCOTCHMAN&mdash;GYPSY NAMES</p>
<p>On the following day there was much feasting amongst the
Romany chals of Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s party.&nbsp; Throughout
the forenoon the Romany chies did scarcely anything but cook
flesh, and the flesh which they cooked was swine&rsquo;s
flesh.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock, the chals and chies
dividing themselves into various parties sat down and partook of
the fare, which was partly roasted, partly sodden.&nbsp; I dined
that day with Mr. Petulengro, and his wife and family, Ursula,
Mr. and Mrs. Chikno, and Sylvester and his two children.&nbsp;
Sylvester, it will be as <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>well to say;
was a widower, and had consequently no one to cook his victuals
for him, supposing he had any, which was not always the case,
Sylvester&rsquo;s affairs being seldom in a prosperous
state.&nbsp; He was noted for his bad success in trafficking,
notwithstanding the many hints which he received from Jasper,
under whose protection he had placed himself, even as Tawno
Chikno had done, who himself, as the reader has heard on a former
occasion, was anything but a wealthy subject, though he was at
all times better off than Sylvester, the Lazarus of the Romany
tribe.</p>
<p>All our party ate with a good appetite, except myself, who,
feeling rather melancholy that day, had little desire to
eat.&nbsp; I did not, like the others, partake of the pork, but
got my dinner entirely off the body of a squirrel which had been
shot the day before by a chal <a name="citation43a"></a><a
href="#footnote43a" class="citation">[43a]</a> of the name of
Piramus, who, besides being a good shot, was celebrated for his
skill in playing on the fiddle.&nbsp; During the dinner a horn
filled with ale passed frequently around; I drank of it more than
once, and felt inspirited by the draughts.&nbsp; The repast
concluded, Sylvester and his children departed to their tent, and
Mr. Petulengro, Tawno, and myself getting up, went and lay down
under a shady hedge, where Mr. Petulengro, lighting his pipe,
began to smoke, and where Tawno presently fell asleep.&nbsp; I
was about to fall asleep also, when I heard the sound of music
and song.&nbsp; Piramus was playing on the fiddle, whilst Mrs.
Chikno, who had a voice of her own, was singing in tones sharp
enough, but of great power, a gypsy song:</p>

my younger days for a lady&rsquo;s album.</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to me ye Roman lads, who are seated in the
straw about the fire, and I will tell how we poison the porker, I
will tell how we poison the porker.</p>
<p>We go to the house of the poison monger, <a
name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"

worth of bane, and when we return to our people we say, we will
poison the porker; we will try and poison the porker.</p>
<p>We then make up the poison, and then we take our way to the
house of the farmer, as if to beg a bit of victuals, a little
broken victuals.</p>
<p>We see a jolly porker, and then we say in Roman language,
&lsquo;Fling the bane yonder amongst the dirt, and the porker
soon will find it, the porker soon will find it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Early on the morrow, we will return to the farm house, and beg
the dead porker, the body of the dead porker.</p>
<p>And so we do, even so we do; the porker dieth during the
night; on the morrow we beg the porker, and carry to the tent the
porker.</p>
<p>And then we wash the inside <a name="citation45b"></a><a

inside is perfectly clean, till there&rsquo;s no bane within it,
not a poison grain within it.</p>
<p>And then we roast the body well, send for ale to the alehouse,
and have a merry banquet, a merry Roman banquet.</p>

47</span>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s some kernel in those songs,
brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, when the songs and music
were over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;they are certainly very
remarkable songs.&nbsp; I say, Jasper, I hope you have not been
drabbing baulor <a name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a> lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And suppose we have, brother, what then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, it is a very dangerous practice, to say nothing of
the wickedness of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Necessity has no law, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have always said
so, but you are not necessitous, and should not drab
baulor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who told you we had been drabbing
baulor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you have had a banquet of pork, and after the
banquet Mrs. Chikno sang a song about drabbing baulor, so I
naturally thought you might have lately been engaged in such a
thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brother, you occasionally utter a word or two of
common-sense.&nbsp; It was natural for you to suppose, after
seeing that dinner of pork, and hearing that song, that we had
been drabbing baulor; I will now tell you that we have not been
doing so.&nbsp; What have you to say to that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I am very glad of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had you tasted that pork, brother, you would have found
that it was sweet and tasty, which balluva <a
name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a> that is drabbed can hardly be expected
to be.&nbsp; We have no reason to drab baulor at present, we have
money and credit; but necessity has no law.&nbsp; Our forefathers
occasionally drabbed baulor, some of our people may still do such
a thing, but only from compulsion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and at your merry meetings
you sing songs upon the compulsatory deeds of your people, alias
their villainous actions; and after all, what would the stirring
poetry of any nation be, but for its compulsatory deeds?&nbsp;
Look at the poetry of Scotland, the heroic part founded almost
entirely on the villainous deeds of the Scotch nation;
cow-stealing, for example, which is very little better than
drabbing baulor; whilst the softer part is mostly about the slips
of its females among the broom, so that no upholder of Scotch
poetry could censure Ursula&rsquo;s song as indelicate, even if
he understood it.&nbsp; What do you think, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think, brother, as I before said, that occasionally
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>you utter a word of common-sense; you were talking of
the Scotch, brother; what do you think of a Scotchman finding
fault with Romany?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Scotchman finding fault with Romany, Jasper?&nbsp; Oh
dear, but you joke, the thing could never be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; and at Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle; what do you think
of a Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s
fiddle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s
fiddle! nonsense, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know what I most dislike, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not, unless it be the constable,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not the constable, it&rsquo;s a beggar on
horseback, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by a beggar on horseback?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, a scamp, brother, raised above his proper place,
who takes every opportunity of giving himself fine airs.&nbsp;
About a week ago, my people and myself camped on a green by a
plantation in the neighbourhood of a great house.&nbsp; In the
evening we were making merry, the girls were dancing, while
Piramus was playing on the fiddle a tune of his own composing, to
which he has given his own name, Piramus of Rome, and which is
much celebrated amongst our people, and from which I have been
told that one of the grand gorgio composers, who once heard it,
has taken several hints.&nbsp; So, as we were making merry, a
great many grand people&mdash;lords and ladies, I believe, came
from the great house and looked on, as the girls danced to the
tune of Piramus of Rome, and seemed much pleased; and when the
girls had left off dancing, and Piramus playing, the ladies
wanted to have their fortunes told; so I bade Mikailia Chikno,
who can tell a fortune when she pleases better than anyone else,
tell them a fortune, and she, being in a good mind, told them a
fortune which pleased them very much.&nbsp; So after they had
heard their fortunes, one of them asked if any of our women could
sing, and I told them several could, more particularly
Leviathan&mdash;you know Leviathan, she is not here now, but some
miles distant, she is our best singer, Ursula coming next.&nbsp;
So the lady said she should like to hear Leviathan sing,
whereupon Leviathan sang the Gudlo pesham, <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> and Piramus played the tune of the same
name, which, as you know, means the honeycomb, the song and the
tune being well entitled to the name, being <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>wonderfully
sweet.&nbsp; Well, everybody present seemed mighty well pleased
with the song and music, with the exception of one person, a
carroty-haired Scotch body; how he came there I don&rsquo;t know,
but there he was; and coming forward, he began in Scotch as broad
as a barndoor, to find fault with the music and the song, saying
that he had never heard viler stuff than either.&nbsp; Well,
brother, out of consideration for the civil gentry with whom the
fellow had come, I held my peace for a long time, and in order to
get the subject changed, I said to Mikailia in Romany, &lsquo;you
have told the ladies their fortunes, now tell the gentlemen
theirs, quick, quick&mdash;pen lende dukkerin. <a
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>&nbsp; Well, brother, the Scotchman, I
suppose, thinking I was speaking ill of him, fell into a greater
passion than before, and catching hold of the word
dukkerin&mdash;&ldquo;Dukkerin,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s dukkerin?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dukkerin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is fortune&mdash;a man or
woman&rsquo;s destiny; don&rsquo;t you like the
word?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Word! d&rsquo;ye ca&rsquo; that a word?
a bonnie word,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll
tell us what it is in Scotch,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in order that
we may improve our language by a Scotch word; a pal of mine has
told me that we have taken a great many words from foreign
lingos.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, then, if that be the case,
fellow, I will tell you; it is e&rsquo;en
&lsquo;spaeing,&rsquo;&rdquo; said he very seriously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my own
word, which is much the prettiest&mdash;spaeing! spaeing! why, I
should be ashamed to make use of the word, it sounds so much like
a certain other word,&rdquo; and then I made a face as if I were
unwell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Scotch also for
that?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do ye mean by speaking in that
guise to a gentleman?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you insolent
vagabond, without a name or a country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There
you are mistaken,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my country is Egypt, but
we &rsquo;Gyptians, like you Scotch, are rather fond of
travelling, and as for name&mdash;my name is Jasper Petulengro,
perhaps you have a better; what is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sandy
Macraw.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that, brother, the gentlemen burst into a
roar of laughter, and all the ladies tittered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were rather severe on the Scotchman,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all, brother, and suppose I were, he began
first; I am the civilest man in the world, and never interfere
with anybody who lets me and mine alone.&nbsp; He finds <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>fault
with Romany, forsooth! why L---d A&rsquo;mighty, what&rsquo;s
Scotch?&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t like our songs; what are his
own?&nbsp; I understand them as little as he mine; I have heard
one or two of them, and pretty rubbish they seemed.&nbsp; But the
best of the joke is, the fellow&rsquo;s finding fault with
Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle&mdash;a chap from the land of bagpipes
finding fault with Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle!&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ll
back that fiddle against all the bagpipes in Scotland, and
Piramus against all the bagpipers; for though Piramus weighs but
ten stone, he shall flog a Scotchman of twenty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Scotchmen are never so fat as that,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;unless indeed, they have been a long time pensioners of
England.&nbsp; I say, Jasper, what remarkable names your people
have!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what pretty names, brother; there&rsquo;s my own,
for example, Jasper; then there&rsquo;s Ambrose <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a> and Sylvester; then there&rsquo;s
Culvato, which signifies Claude; then there&rsquo;s Piramus,
that&rsquo;s a nice name brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there&rsquo;s your wife&rsquo;s name, Pakomovna,
then there&rsquo;s Ursula and Morella.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, brother, there&rsquo;s Ercilla.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ercilla! the name of the great poet of Spain, how
wonderful; then Leviathan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The name of a ship, brother; Leviathan was named after
a ship, so don&rsquo;t make a wonder out of her.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s Sanpriel and Synfye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and Clementina and Lavinia, Camillia and Lydia,
Curlanda, and Orlanda; wherever did they get those
names?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did my wife get her necklace, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She knows best, Jasper.&nbsp; I hope&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, no hoping!&nbsp; She got it from her grandmother,
who died at the age of a hundred and three, and sleeps in
Coggeshall churchyard.&nbsp; She got it from her mother, who also
died very old, and who could give no other account of it than
that it had been in the family time out of mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whence could they have got it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, perhaps where they got their names, brother.&nbsp;
A gentleman who had travelled much, once told me that he had seen
the sister of it about the neck of an Indian queen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of your names, Jasper, appear to be church
names&mdash;your own, for example, and Ambrose and <!-- page
51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Sylvester; perhaps you got them from the Papists, in the
times of Popery, but where did you get such a name as Piramus, a
name of Grecian romance.&nbsp; Then some of them appear to be
Slavonian; for example Mikailia and Pakomovna.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know much of Slavonian; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is Slavonian, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The family name of certain nations, the principal of
which is the Russian, and from which the word slave is originally
derived.&nbsp; You have heard of the Russians, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother, and seen some.&nbsp; I saw their crallis
at the time of the peace; he was not a bad-looking man for a
Russian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By-the-bye, Jasper, I&rsquo;m half inclined to think
that crallis <a name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a> is a Slavish word.&nbsp; I saw
something like it in a lil <a name="citation51b"></a><a
href="#footnote51b" class="citation">[51b]</a> called
&ldquo;Voltaire&rsquo;s Life of Charles.&rdquo;&nbsp; How you
should have come by such names and words is to me
incomprehensible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem posed, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really know very little about you, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very little indeed, brother.&nbsp; We know very little
about ourselves, and you know nothing, save what we have told
you; and we have now and then told you things about us which are
not exactly true, simply to make a fool of you brother.&nbsp; You
will say that was wrong; perhaps it was.&nbsp; Well, Sunday will
be here in a day or two, when we will go to church, where
possibly we shall hear a sermon on the disastrous consequences of
lying.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>THE CHURCH&mdash;THE ARISTOCRATICAL PEW&mdash;DAYS OF
YORE&mdash;THE CLERGYMAN&mdash;&lsquo;IN WHAT WOULD A MAN BE
PROFITED?&rsquo;</p>
<p>When two days had passed, Sunday came; I breakfasted by myself
in the solitary dingle; and then, having set things a little to
rights, I ascended to Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; I
could hear church-bells ringing around in the distance, appearing
to say, &lsquo;Come to church, come to church,&rsquo; as clearly
as it was possible <!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>for church-bells to say.&nbsp; I
found Mr. Petulengro seated by the door of his tent, smoking his
pipe, in rather an ungenteel undress.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
Jasper,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;are you ready to go to church; for
if you are, I am ready to accompany you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
not ready, brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;nor is my
wife; the church, too, to which we shall go is three miles off <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a>; so it is of no use to think of going
there this morning, as the service would be three-quarters over
before we got there; if, however, you are disposed to go in the
afternoon, we are your people.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I returned
to my dingle, where I passed several hours in conning the Welsh
Bible, which the preacher, Peter Williams, had given me.</p>
<p>At last I gave over reading, took a slight refreshment, and
was about to emerge from the dingle, when I heard the voice of
Mr. Petulengro calling me.&nbsp; I went up again to the
encampment, where I found Mr. Petulengro, his wife, and Tawno
Chikno, ready to proceed to church.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro
were dressed in Roman fashion, though not in the full-blown
manner in which they had paid their visit to Isopel and
myself.&nbsp; Tawno had on a clean white slop, with a nearly new
black beaver, with very broad rims, and the nap exceedingly
long.&nbsp; As for myself, I was dressed in much the same manner
as that in which I departed from London, having on, in honour of
the day, a shirt perfectly clean, having washed one on purpose
for the occasion, with my own hands, the day before, in the pond
of tepid water in which the newts and efts were in the habit of
taking their pleasure.&nbsp; We proceeded for upwards of a mile,
by footpaths through meadows and corn-fields; we crossed various
stiles; at last, passing over one, we found ourselves in a road,
wending along which for a considerable distance, we at last came
in sight of a church, the bells of which had been tolling
distinctly in our ears for some time; before, however, we reached
the church-yard the bells had ceased their melody.&nbsp; It was
surrounded by lofty beech-trees of brilliant green foliage.&nbsp;
We entered the gate, Mrs. Petulengro leading the way, and
proceeded to a small door near the east end of the church.&nbsp;
As we advanced, the sound of singing within the church rose upon
our ears.&nbsp; Arrived at the small door, Mrs. Petulengro opened
it and entered, followed by Tawno Chikno.&nbsp; I myself went
last <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>of all, following Mr. Petulengro, who, before I entered,
turned round, and, with a significant nod, advised me to take
care how I behaved.&nbsp; The part of the church which we had
entered was the chancel; on one side stood a number of venerable
old men&mdash;probably the neighbouring poor&mdash;and on the
other a number of poor girls belonging to the village school,
dressed in white gowns and straw bonnets, whom two elegant but
simply dressed young women were superintending.&nbsp; Every voice
seemed to be united in singing a certain anthem, which,
notwithstanding it was written neither by Tate nor Brady,
contains some of the sublimest words which were ever put
together, not the worst of which are those which burst on our
ears as we entered.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Every eye shall now behold Him,<br />
Robed in dreadful majesty;<br />
Those who set at nought and sold Him,<br />
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply wailing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the true Messiah
see.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still following Mrs. Petulengro, we proceeded down the chancel
and along the aisle; notwithstanding the singing, I could
distinctly hear as we passed many a voice whispering, &lsquo;Here
come the gypsies! here come the gypsies!&rsquo;&nbsp; I felt
rather embarrassed, with a somewhat awkward doubt as to where we
were to sit; none of the occupiers of the pews, who appeared to
consist almost entirely of farmers, with their wives, sons and
daughters, opened a door to admit us.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro,
however, appeared to feel not the least embarrassment, but
tripped along the aisle with the greatest nonchalance.&nbsp; We
passed under the pulpit, in which stood the clergyman in his
white surplice, and reached the middle of the church, where we
were confronted by the sexton dressed in long blue coat, and
holding in his hand a wand.&nbsp; This functionary motioned
towards the lower end of the church, where were certain benches,
partly occupied by poor people and boys.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro,
however, with a toss of her head, directed her course to a
magnificent pew, which was unoccupied, which she opened and
entered, followed closely by Tawno Chikno, Mr. Petulengro, and
myself.&nbsp; The sexton did not appear by any means to approve
of the arrangement, and as I stood next the door <!-- page
54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>laid
his finger on my arm, as if to intimate that myself and
companions must quit our aristocratical location.&nbsp; I said
nothing, but directed my eyes to the clergyman, who uttered a
short and expressive cough; the sexton looked at him for a
moment, and then, bowing his head, closed the door&mdash;in a
moment more the music ceased.&nbsp; I took up a Prayer-book, on
which was engraved an earl&rsquo;s coronet.&nbsp; The clergyman
uttered, &lsquo;I will arise and go to my father.&rsquo;&nbsp;
England&rsquo;s sublime liturgy had commenced.</p>
<p>Oh what feelings came over me on finding myself again in an
edifice devoted to the religion of my country.&nbsp; I had not
been in such a place I cannot tell for how long&mdash;certainly
not for years; and now I had found my way there again, it
appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew of the old church
of pretty D---. <a name="citation54a"></a><a href="#footnote54a"
class="citation">[54a]</a>&nbsp; I had occasionally done so when
a child, and had suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Yes, surely I had been
asleep and had woken up; but, no! alas, no!&nbsp; I had not been
asleep&mdash;at least not in the old church&mdash;if I had been
asleep I had been walking in my sleep, struggling, striving,
learning, and unlearning in my sleep.&nbsp; Years had rolled away
whilst I had been asleep&mdash;ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit
had come on whilst I had been asleep&mdash;how circumstances had
altered, and above all myself, whilst I had been asleep.&nbsp;
No, I had not been asleep in the old church!&nbsp; I was in a pew
it is true, but not the pew of black leather, in which I
sometimes fell asleep in days of yore, but in a strange pew; and
then my companions, they were no longer those of days of
yore.&nbsp; I was no longer with my respectable father and
mother, and my dear brother, but with the gypsy cral <a
name="citation54b"></a><a href="#footnote54b"
class="citation">[54b]</a> and his wife, and the gigantic Tawno,
the Antinous of the dusky people.&nbsp; And what was I
myself?&nbsp; No longer an innocent child, but a moody man,
bearing in my face, as I knew well, the marks of my strivings and
strugglings, of what I had learnt and unlearnt; nevertheless, the
general aspect of things brought to my mind what I had felt and
seen of yore.&nbsp; There was difference enough it is true, but
still there was a similarity&mdash;at least I thought
so&mdash;the church, the clergyman, and the clerk, differing in
many respects from those of pretty D---, put me strangely in mind
of them; and then the words!&mdash;by-the-by, was it not the
magic of the words which brought the dear enchanting past so
powerfully before the <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>mind of Lavengro? for the words were
the same sonorous words of high import which had first made an
impression on his childish ear in the old church of pretty
D---.</p>
<p>The liturgy was now over, during the reading of which my
companions behaved in a most unexceptionable manner, sitting down
and rising up when other people sat down and rose, and holding in
their hands Prayer-books which they found in the pew, into which
they stared intently, though I observed that, with the exception
of Mrs. Petulengro, who knew how to read a little, they held the
books by the top, and not the bottom, as is the usual way.&nbsp;
The clergyman now ascended the pulpit, arrayed in his black
gown.&nbsp; The congregation composed themselves to attention, as
did also my companions, who fixed their eyes upon the clergyman
with a certain strange immovable stare, which I believe to be
peculiar to their race.&nbsp; The clergyman gave out his text,
and began to preach.&nbsp; He was a tall, gentlemanly man,
seemingly between fifty and sixty, with greyish hair; his
features were very handsome, but with a somewhat melancholy cast:
the tones of his voice were rich and noble, but also with
somewhat of melancholy in them.&nbsp; The text which he gave out
was the following one, &lsquo;In what would a man be profited,
provided he gained the whole world, and lost his own
soul?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And on this text the clergyman preached long and well: he did
not read his sermon, but spoke it extempore; his doing so rather
surprised and offended me at first; I was not used to such a
style of preaching in a church devoted to the religion of my
country.&nbsp; I compared it within my mind with the style of
preaching used by the high-church rector in the old church of
pretty D---, and I thought to myself it was very different, and
being very different I did not like it, and I thought to myself
how scandalized the people of D--- would have been had they heard
it, and I figured to myself how indignant the high-church clerk
would have been had any clergyman got up in the church of D---
and preached in such a manner.&nbsp; Did it not savour strongly
of dissent, methodism, and similar low stuff?&nbsp; Surely it
did; why the Methodist I had heard preach on the heath above the
old city, preached in the same manner&mdash;at least he preached
extempore; ay, and something like the present clergyman, for the
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Methodist spoke very zealously and with great feeling,
and so did the present clergyman; so I, of course, felt rather
offended with the clergyman for speaking with zeal and
feeling.&nbsp; However, long before the sermon was over I forgot
the offence which I had taken, and listened to the sermon with
much admiration, for the eloquence and powerful reasoning with
which it abounded.</p>
<p>Oh how eloquent he was when he talked of the inestimable value
of a man&rsquo;s soul, which he said endured for ever, whilst his
body, as everyone knew, lasted at most for a very contemptible
period of time; and how forcibly he reasoned on the folly of a
man, who, for the sake of gaining the whole world&mdash;a thing,
he said, which provided he gained he could only possess for a
part of the time, during which his perishable body
existed&mdash;should lose his soul, that is, cause that precious
deathless portion of him to suffer indescribable misery time
without end.</p>
<p>There was one part of his sermon which struck me in a very
particular manner, he said: &lsquo;That there were some people
who gained something in return for their souls; if they did not
get the whole world, they got a part of it&mdash;lands, wealth,
honour, or renown; mere trifles, he allowed, in comparison with
the value of a man&rsquo;s soul, which is destined either to
enjoy delight, or suffer tribulation time without end; but which,
in the eyes of the worldly, had a certain value, and which
afforded a certain pleasure and satisfaction.&nbsp; But there
were also others who lost their souls and got nothing for
them&mdash;neither lands, wealth, renown, nor consideration, who
were poor outcasts, and despised by everybody.&nbsp; My
friends,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;if the man is a fool who barters
his soul for the whole world, what a fool he must be who barters
his soul for nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the clergyman, as he uttered these words, wandered
around the whole congregation, and when he had concluded them,
the eyes of the whole congregation were turned upon my companions
and myself.</p>

57</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>RETURN FROM CHURCH&mdash;THE CUCKOO AND GYPSY&mdash;SPIRITUAL
DISCOURSE</p>
<p>The service over, my companions and myself returned towards
the encampment by the way we came.&nbsp; Some of the humble part
of the congregation laughed and joked at us as we passed.&nbsp;
Mr. Petulengro and his wife, however, returned their laughs and
jokes with interest.&nbsp; As for Tawno and myself, we said
nothing; Tawno, like most handsome fellows, having very little to
say for himself at any time; and myself, though not handsome, not
being particularly skilful at repartee.&nbsp; Some boys followed
us for a considerable time, making all kinds of observations
about gypsies, but as we walked at a great pace, we gradually
left them behind, and at last lost sight of them.&nbsp; Mrs.
Petulengro and Tawno Chikno walked together, even as they had
come, whilst Mr. Petulengro and myself followed at a little
distance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a very fine preacher we heard,&rsquo; said I
to Mr. Petulengro, after we had crossed the stile into the
fields.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very fine, indeed, brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&lsquo;he is talked of, far and wide, for his sermons; folks say
that there is scarcely another like him in the whole of
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He looks rather melancholy, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He lost his wife several years ago, who, they say, was
one of the most beautiful women ever seen.&nbsp; They say that it
was grief for her loss that made him come out mighty strong as a
preacher; for, though he was a clergyman, he was never heard of
in the pulpit before he lost his wife; since then the whole
country has rung with the preaching of the clergyman of M---, <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a> as they call him.&nbsp; Those two nice
young gentlewomen whom you saw with the female childer are his
daughters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to know all about him, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you
ever hear him preach before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, brother; but he has frequently been to our tent,
and his daughters, too, and given us tracts; for he <!-- page
58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>is
one of the people they call Evangelicals, who give folks tracts
which they cannot read.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should learn to read, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have no time, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you not frequently idle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, brother; when we are not engaged in our traffic
we are engaged in taking our relaxation, so we have no time to
learn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really should make an effort.&nbsp; If you were
disposed to learn to read, I would endeavour to assist you.&nbsp;
You would be all the better for knowing how to read.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In what way, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, you could read the Scriptures, and by so doing
learn your duty towards your fellow-creatures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know that already, brother; the constables and
justices have contrived to knock that tolerably into our
heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet you frequently break the laws.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, I believe, do now and then those who know how to
read, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very true, Jasper; but you really ought to learn to
read, as by so doing you might learn your duty towards
yourselves, and your chief duty is to take care of your own
souls; did not the preacher say: &ldquo;In what is a man
profited, provided he gain the whole world?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have not much of the world, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very little indeed, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you not observe
how the eyes of the whole congregation were turned towards our
pew when the preacher said, &ldquo;There are some people who lose
their souls, and get nothing in exchange; who are outcast,
despised, and miserable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, was not what he said
quite applicable to the gypsies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are not miserable, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, you ought to be, Jasper.&nbsp; Have you an
inch of ground of your own.&nbsp; Are you of the least use?&nbsp;
Are you not spoken ill of by everybody?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a
gypsy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the bird noising yonder,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bird!&nbsp; Oh, that&rsquo;s the cuckoo tolling;
but what has the cuckoo to do with the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see, brother; what&rsquo;s the
cuckoo?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it? you know as much about it as myself,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a kind of roguish, chaffing bird,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe it is, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody knows whence it comes, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe not, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very poor, brother, not a nest of its own?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So they say, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With every person&rsquo;s bad word, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jasper, every person is mocking it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tolerably merry, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, tolerably merry, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None whatever, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would be glad to get rid of the cuckoos,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, not exactly, Jasper; the cuckoo is a pleasant,
funny bird, and its presence and voice give a great charm to the
green trees and fields; no, I can&rsquo;t say I wish exactly to
get rid of the cuckoo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother, what&rsquo;s a Romany chal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must answer that question yourself,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A roguish, chaffing fellow, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so, Jasper; I see&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something very much like a cuckoo, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see what you are after, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would like to get rid of us, wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no, not exactly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are no ornament to the green lanes in spring and
summer time, are we, brother? and the voices of our chies with
their cukkerin <a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a> and dukkerin <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a> don&rsquo;t help to make them
pleasant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see what you are at, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would wish to turn the cuckoos into barn-door
fowls, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say I should, Jasper, whatever some people
might wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the chals and chies into radical weavers and
factory wenches, hey, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I should, Jasper.&nbsp; You are
certainly a picturesque people, and in many respects an ornament
both to town and country; painting and lil writing <a
name="citation59c"></a><a href="#footnote59c"
class="citation">[59c]</a> too, are under great obligations to
you.&nbsp; What pretty pictures <!-- page 60--><a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>are made out
of your campings and groupings, and what pretty books have been
written in which gypsies, or at least creatures intended to
represent gypsies, have been the principal figures.&nbsp; I think
if we were without you, we should begin to miss you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just as you would the cuckoos, if they were all
converted into barn-door fowls.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother,
frequently as I have sat under a hedge in spring or summer time
and heard the cuckoo, I have thought that we chals and cuckoos
are alike in many respects, but especially in character.&nbsp;
Everybody speaks ill of us both, and everybody is glad to see
both of us again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jasper, but there is some difference between men
and cuckoos; men have souls, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why not cuckoos, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not talk so, Jasper; what you say is little
short of blasphemy.&nbsp; How should a bird have a
soul?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how should a man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, we know very well that a man has a soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you take your oath of it, brother&mdash;your
bodily oath?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I think I might, Jasper!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever see the soul, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I never saw it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then how could you swear to it?&nbsp; A pretty figure
you would make in a court of justice, to swear to a thing which
you never saw.&nbsp; Hold up your head, fellow.&nbsp; When and
where did you see it?&nbsp; Now upon your oath, fellow, do you
mean to say that this Roman stole the donkey&rsquo;s foal?&nbsp;
Oh, there&rsquo;s no one for cross-questioning like Counsellor
P---.&nbsp; Our people when they are in a hobble always like to
employ him, though he is somewhat dear.&nbsp; Now, brother, how
can you get over the &ldquo;upon your oath, fellow, will you say
that you have a soul?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we will take no oaths on the subject; but you
yourself believe in the soul.&nbsp; I have heard you say that you
believe in dukkerin; now what is dukkerin but the soul
science?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When did I say that I believed in it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, after that fight, when you pointed to the bloody
mark in the cloud, whilst he you wot of was galloping in <!--
page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>the barouch to the old town, amidst the rain-cataracts,
the thunder, and flame of heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have some kind of remembrance of it,
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, again, I heard you say that the dook <a
name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a> of Abershaw rode every night on
horseback down the wooded hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, brother, what a wonderful memory you
have!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I had not, Jasper, but I can&rsquo;t help it, it
is my misfortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Misfortune! well, perhaps it is; at any rate it is very
ungenteel to have such a memory.&nbsp; I have heard my wife say
that to show you have a long memory looks very vulgar, and that
you can&rsquo;t give a greater proof of gentility than by
forgetting a thing as soon as possible&mdash;more especially a
promise, or an acquaintance when he happens to be shabby.&nbsp;
Well, brother, I don&rsquo;t deny that I may have said that I
believe in dukkerin, and in Abershaw&rsquo;s dook, which you say
is his soul; but what I believe one moment, or say I believe,
don&rsquo;t be certain that I shall believe the next, or say I
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, Jasper, I heard you say on a previous occasion
on quoting a piece of a song, <a name="citation61b"></a><a
href="#footnote61b" class="citation">[61b]</a> that when a man
dies he is cast into the earth and there&rsquo;s an end of
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did, did I?&nbsp; Lor&rsquo; what a memory you have,
brother.&nbsp; But you are not sure that I hold that opinion
now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not, Jasper.&nbsp; Indeed, after such a
sermon as we have been hearing, I should be very shocked if you
held such an opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, brother, don&rsquo;t be sure I do not, however
shocking such an opinion may be to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What an incomprehensible people you are,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are rather so, brother; indeed, we have posed wiser
heads than yours before now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to care for so little, and yet you rove about
a distinct race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of our women?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have certainly very singular names,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Names!&nbsp; Lavengro!&nbsp; However, brother, if you
had been as fond of things as of names, you would never have been
a pal of ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&lsquo;What do you mean, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they rum animals?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have tongues of their own, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever feel their teeth and nails,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, Jasper, save Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have
always been very civil to them, so&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They let you alone.&nbsp; I say, brother, some part of
the secret is in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They seem rather flighty, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, brother!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather fond of loose discourse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather so, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you always trust them, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We never watch them, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can they always trust you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not quite so well as we can them.&nbsp; However, we get
on very well together, except Mikailia and her husband; but
Mikailia is a cripple, and is married to the beauty of the world,
so she may be expected to be jealous&mdash;though he would not
part with her for a duchess, no more than I would part with my
rawnie, <a name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a> nor any other chal with
his.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, but would not the chi part with the chal for a
duke, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My Pakomovna gave up the duke for me,
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she occasionally talks of him, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother, but Pakomovna was born on a common not
far from the sign of the gammon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gammon of bacon, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother; but gammon likewise
means&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it does, Jasper; it means fun, ridicule, jest;
it is an ancient Norse word, and is found in the Edda.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how learned in lils you
are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many words of Norse are to be found in our vulgar
sayings, Jasper; for example&mdash;in that particularly vulgar
saying of ours, &ldquo;Your mother is up,&rdquo; <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a> there&rsquo;s a noble Norse word;
mother, there, meaning not the female who bore us, but rage and
choler, as I discovered by reading the Sagas, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&lsquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how book-learned you
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indifferently so, Jasper.&nbsp; Then you think you
might trust your wife with the duke?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I could, brother, or even with
yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Myself, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh, I never troubled my head
about your wife; but I suppose there have been love affairs
between gorgios and Romany chies. <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a>&nbsp; Why novels are
stuffed with such matters; and then even one of your own songs
says so&mdash;the song which Ursula was singing the other
afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is somewhat of an old song, brother, and is sung
by the chies as a warning at our solemn festivals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! but there&rsquo;s your sister-in-law, Ursula,
herself, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ursula, herself, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were talking of my having her, Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother, why didn&rsquo;t you have
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would she have had me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, brother.&nbsp; You are so much of a Roman,
and speak Romany so remarkably well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor thing! she looks very innocent!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remarkably so, brother! however, though not born on the
same common with my wife, she knows a thing or two of Roman
matters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to ask her a question or two, Jasper, in
connection with that song.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You can do no better, brother.&nbsp; Here we are at the
camp.&nbsp; After tea, take Ursula under a hedge, and ask her a
question or two in connection with that song.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>SUNDAY EVENING&mdash;URSULA&mdash;ACTION AT
LAW&mdash;MERIDIANA&mdash;MARRIED ALREADY</p>
<p>I took tea that evening with Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro and
Ursula, outside of their tent.&nbsp; Tawno was not present, being
engaged with his wife in his own tabernacle; Sylvester was there,
however, lolling listlessly upon the ground.&nbsp; As I looked
upon this man, I thought him one of the most disagreeable fellows
I had ever seen.&nbsp; <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>His features were ugly, and,
moreover, as dark as pepper; and, besides being dark, his skin
was dirty.&nbsp; As for his dress, it was torn and sordid.&nbsp;
His chest was broad, and his arms seemed powerful; but, upon the
whole, he looked a very caitiff.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sorry that man
has lost his wife,&rsquo; thought I; &lsquo;for I am sure he will
never get another.&rsquo;&nbsp; What surprises me is, that he
ever found a woman disposed to unite her lot with his!</p>
<p>After tea I got up and strolled about the field.&nbsp; My
thoughts were upon Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I wondered where she
was, and how long she would stay away.&nbsp; At length becoming
tired and listless, I determined to return to the dingle, and
resume the reading of the Bible at the place where I had left
off.&nbsp; &lsquo;What better could I do,&rsquo; methought,
&lsquo;on a Sunday evening?&rsquo;&nbsp; I was then near the wood
which surrounded the dingle, but at that side which was farthest
from the encampment, which stood near the entrance.&nbsp;
Suddenly, on turning round the southern corner of the copse,
which surrounded the dingle, I perceived Ursula seated under a
thorn-bush.&nbsp; I thought I never saw her look prettier than
then, dressed as she was, in her Sunday&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-evening, Ursula,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I little
thought to have the pleasure of seeing you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor would you, brother,&rsquo; said Ursula, &lsquo;had
not Jasper told me that you had been talking about me, and wanted
to speak to me under a hedge; so, hearing that, I watched your
motions, and came here and sat down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was thinking of going to my quarters in the dingle,
to read the Bible, Ursula, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, pray then, go to your quarters, brother, and read
the Miduveleskoe lil; <a name="citation64"></a><a
href="#footnote64" class="citation">[64]</a> you can speak to me
under a hedge some other time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I will sit down with you, Ursula; for, after
all, reading godly books in dingles at eve, is rather sombre
work.&nbsp; Yes, I think I will sit down with you;&rsquo; and I
sat down by her side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother, now you have sat down with me under the
hedge, what have you to say to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I hardly know, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not know, brother; a pretty fellow you to ask young
women to come and sit with you under hedges, and, when they come,
not know what to say to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&lsquo;Oh! ah!&nbsp; I remember; do you know, Ursula,
that I take a great interest in you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank ye, brother; kind of you, at any rate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be exposed to a great many temptations,
Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A great many indeed, brother.&nbsp; It is hard to see
fine things, such as shawls, gold watches, and chains in the
shops, behind the big glasses, and to know that they are not
intended for one.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I have been tempted
to make a dash at them; but I bethought myself that by so doing I
should cut my hands, besides being almost certain of being
grabbed and sent across the gull&rsquo;s bath to the foreign
country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you think gold and fine things temptations,
Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, brother, very great temptations; don&rsquo;t
you think them so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then more fool you, brother; but have the kindness to
tell me what you would call a temptation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, for example, the hope of honour and renown,
Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hope of honour and renown! very good, brother; but
I tell you one thing, that unless you have money in your pocket,
and good broadcloth on your back, you are not likely to obtain
much honour and&mdash;what do you call it? amongst the gorgios,
to say nothing of the Romany chals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have thought, Ursula, that the Romany chals,
roaming about the world as they do, free and independent, were
above being led by such trifles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you know nothing of the gypsies, brother; no
people on earth are fonder of those trifles, as you call them,
than the Romany chals, and more disposed to respect those who
have them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then money and fine clothes would induce you to do
anything, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay; brother, anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To chore, <a name="citation65a"></a><a
href="#footnote65a" class="citation">[65a]</a> Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like enough, brother; gypsies have been transported
before now for choring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To hokkawar?&rsquo; <a name="citation65b"></a><a
href="#footnote65b" class="citation">[65b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&lsquo;Ay, ay, I was telling dukkerin only yesterday,
brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In fact, to break the law in everything?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who knows, brother, who knows? as I said before, gold
and fine clothes are great temptations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ursula, I am sorry for it, I should never have
thought you so depraved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To think that I am seated by one who is willing
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To play the thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The liar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The&mdash;the lubbeny.&rsquo; <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;The what, brother?&rsquo; said Ursula, starting from
her seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the lubbeny; don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you what, brother,&rsquo; said Ursula, looking
somewhat pale, and speaking very low, &lsquo;if I had only
something in my hand, I would do you a mischief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what is the matter, Ursula?&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;how have I offended you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How have you offended me?&nbsp; Why, didn&rsquo;t you
insinivate just now that I was ready to play
the&mdash;the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not say it; but I only
wish I had something in my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I have offended, Ursula, I am very sorry for it; any
offence I may have given you was from want of understanding
you.&nbsp; Come, pray be seated, I have much to question you
about&mdash;to talk to you about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seated, not I!&nbsp; It was only just now that you gave
me to understand that you was ashamed to be seated by me, a
thief, a liar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, did you not almost give me to understand that you
were both, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t much care being called a thief and a
liar,&rsquo; said Ursula, &lsquo;a person may be a liar and a
thief, and yet a very honest woman, but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&lsquo;Well, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you what, brother, if you ever sinivate again
that I could be the third thing, so help me duvel! <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> I&rsquo;ll do you a mischief.&nbsp; By
my God I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ursula, I assure you that I shall sinivate, as
you call it, nothing of the kind about you.&nbsp; I have no
doubt, from what you have said, that you are a very paragon of
virtue&mdash;a perfect Lucretia; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My name is Ursula, brother, and not Lucretia: Lucretia
is not of our family, but one of the Bucklands; she travels about
Oxfordshire; yet I am as good as she any day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lucretia! how odd!&nbsp; Where could she have got that
name?&nbsp; Well, I make no doubt, Ursula, that you are quite as
good as she, and she as her namesake of ancient Rome; but there
is a mystery in this same virtue, Ursula, which I cannot fathom;
how a thief and a liar should be able, or indeed willing, to
preserve her virtue is what I don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; You
confess that you are very fond of gold.&nbsp; Now, how is it that
you don&rsquo;t barter your virtue for gold sometimes?&nbsp; I am
a philosopher, Ursula, and like to know everything.&nbsp; You
must be every now and then exposed to great temptation, Ursula;
for you are of a beauty calculated to captivate all hearts.&nbsp;
Come, sit down and tell me how you are enabled to resist such a
temptation as gold and fine clothes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother,&rsquo; said Ursula, &lsquo;as you say
you mean no harm, I will sit down beside you, and enter into
discourse with you; but I will uphold that you are the coolest
hand that I ever came nigh, and say the coolest
things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Ursula sat down by my side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ursula, we will, if you please, discourse on the
subject of your temptations.&nbsp; I suppose that you travel very
much about, and show yourself in all kinds of places?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In all kinds, brother; I travels, as you say, very much
about, attends fairs and races, and enters booths and
public-houses, where I tells fortunes, and sometimes dances and
sings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do not people often address you in a very free
manner?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frequently, brother; and I give them tolerably free
answers.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&lsquo;Do people ever offer to make you presents?&nbsp;
I mean presents of value, such as&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silk handkerchiefs, shawls, and trinkets; very
frequently, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do you do, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take what people offers me, brother, and stows it
away as soon as I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, but don&rsquo;t people expect something for their
presents?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean dukkerin, dancing, and the
like; but such a moderate and innocent thing as a choomer, <a
name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a> Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Innocent thing, do you call it, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The world calls it so, Ursula.&nbsp; Well, do the
people who give you the fine things never expect a choomer in
return?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very frequently, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And do you ever grant it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you avoid it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I gets away as soon as possible, brother.&nbsp; If they
follows me, I tries to baffle them, by means of jests and
laughter; and if they persist, I uses bad and terrible language,
of which I have plenty in store.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if your terrible language has no effect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I screams for the constable, and if he comes not,
I uses my teeth and nails.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are they always sufficient?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only had to use them twice, brother; but then I
found them sufficient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But suppose the person who followed you was highly
agreeable, Ursula?&nbsp; A handsome young officer of local
militia, for example, all dressed in Lincoln green, would you
still refuse him the choomer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We makes no difference, brother; the daughters of the
gypsy-father makes no difference; and, what&rsquo;s more, sees
none.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Ursula, the world will hardly give you credit for
such indifference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What cares we for the world, brother! we are not of the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your fathers, brothers, and uncles, give you credit
I suppose, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, brother, our fathers, brothers, and cokos <a

class="citation">[68b]</a> <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>gives us all
manner of credit; for example, I am telling lies and dukkerin in
a public-house where my batu <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a> or
coko&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;are playing on the fiddle; well, my
batu and my coko beholds me amongst the public-house crew,
talking nonsense and hearing nonsense; but they are under no
apprehension; and presently they sees the good-looking officer of
militia, in his greens and Lincolns, get up and give me a wink,
and I go out with him abroad, into the dark night perhaps; well,
my batu and my coko goes on fiddling, just as if I were six miles
off asleep in the tent, and not out in the dark street with the
local officer, with his Lincolns and his greens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They know they can trust you, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay, brother; and, what&rsquo;s more, I knows I can
trust myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you would merely go out to make a fool of him,
Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merely go out to make a fool of him, brother, I assure
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But such proceedings really have an odd look,
Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amongst gorgios, very so, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it must be rather unpleasant to lose one&rsquo;s
character even amongst gorgios, Ursula; and suppose the officer,
out of revenge for being tricked and duped by you, were to say of
you the thing that is not, were to meet you on the race-course
the next day, and boast of receiving favours which he never had,
amidst a knot of jeering militia-men, how would you proceed,
Ursula? would you not be abashed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By no means, brother; I should bring my action of law
against him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your action at law, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother; I should give a whistle, whereupon all
one&rsquo;s cokos and batus, and all my near and distant
relations, would leave their fiddling, dukkerin, and
horse-dealing, and come flocking about me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Ursula?&rdquo; says my
coko.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; I replies, &ldquo;save
and except that gorgio, in his greens and his Lincolns, says that
I have played the --- with him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oho, he does,
Ursula,&rdquo; says my coko, &ldquo;try your action of law
against him, my lamb,&rdquo; and he puts something privily into
my hands; whereupon I goes close up to the <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>grinning
gorgio, and staring him in the face, with my head pushed forward,
I cries out: &ldquo;You say I did what was wrong with you last
night when I was out with you abroad?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the local officer, &ldquo;I says you
did,&rdquo; looking down all the time.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a
liar,&rdquo; says I, and forthwith I breaks his head with the
stick which I holds behind me, and which my coko has conveyed
privily into my hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this is your action at law, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother, this is my action at club-law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would your breaking the fellow&rsquo;s head quite
clear you of all suspicion in the eyes of your batus, cokos, and
what not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They would never suspect me at all, brother, because
they would know that I would never condescend to be over intimate
with a gorgio; the breaking the head would be merely intended to
justify Ursula in the eyes of the gorgios.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And would it clear you in their eyes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it not, brother?&nbsp; When they saw the blood
running down from the fellow&rsquo;s cracked poll on his greens
and Lincolns, they would be quite satisfied; why the fellow would
not be able to show his face at fair or merry-making for a year
and three-quarters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever try it, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say I ever did, brother, but it would
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how did you ever learn such a method of
proceeding?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why &rsquo;t is advised by gypsy liri, <a
name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a> brother.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s part of our
way of settling difficulties amongst ourselves; for example, if a
young Roman were to say the thing which is not respecting Ursula
and himself, Ursula would call a great meeting of the people, who
would all sit down in a ring, the young fellow amongst them; a
coko would then put a stick in Ursula&rsquo;s hand, who would
then get up and go to the young fellow, and say, &ldquo;Did I
play the --- with you?&rdquo; and were he to say
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she would crack his head before the eyes of
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;Ursula, I was bred an
apprentice to gorgio law, and of course ought to stand up for it,
whenever I conscientiously can, but I must say the gypsy manner
of bringing an action for defamation is much less tedious, and
far more satisfactory than the gorgiko one.&nbsp; <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>I
wish you now to clear up a certain point which is rather
mysterious to me.&nbsp; You say that for a Romany chi to do what
is unseemly with a gorgio, is quite out of the question, yet only
the other day I heard you singing a song in which a Romany chi
confesses herself to be cambri <a name="citation71a"></a><a
href="#footnote71a" class="citation">[71a]</a> by a grand
gorgious gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sad let down,&rsquo; said Ursula.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;sad or not, there&rsquo;s
the song that speaks of the thing, which you give me to
understand is not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if the thing ever was,&rsquo; said Ursula,
&lsquo;it was a long time ago, and perhaps after all not
true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why do you sing the song?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, brother; we sings the song now and
then to be a warning to ourselves to have as little to do as
possible in the way of acquaintance with the gorgios; and a
warning it is; you see how the young woman in the song was driven
out of her tent by her mother, with all kind of disgrace and bad
language; but you don&rsquo;t know that she was afterwards buried
alive by her cokos and pals <a name="citation71b"></a><a
href="#footnote71b" class="citation">[71b]</a> in an uninhabited
place; the song doesn&rsquo;t say it, but the story says it, for
there is a story about it, though, as I said before, it was a
long time ago, and perhaps, after all, wasn&rsquo;t
true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if such a thing were to happen at present, would
the cokos and pals bury the girl alive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say what they would do,&rsquo; said
Ursula; &lsquo;I suppose they are not so strict as they were long
ago; at any rate she would be driven from the tan, <a
name="citation71c"></a><a href="#footnote71c"
class="citation">[71c]</a> and avoided by all her family and
relations as a gorgio&rsquo;s acquaintance, so that, perhaps, at
last, she would be glad if they would bury her alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I can conceive that there would be an objection
on the part of the cokos and batus that a Romany chi should form
an improper acquaintance with a gorgio, but I should think that
the batus and cokos could hardly object to the chi&rsquo;s
entering into the honourable estate of wedlock with a
gorgio.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ursula was silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marriage is an honourable estate, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother, suppose it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a Romany chi should object to
enter into the honourable estate of wedlock with a
gorgio.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t, brother; don&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and, moreover, I am aware,
notwithstanding your evasion, Ursula, that marriages and
connections now and then occur between gorgios and Romany chies;
the result of which is the mixed breed called half-and-half,
which is at present travelling about England, and to which the
Flaming Tinman belongs, otherwise called Anselo Herne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for the half-and-halfs,&rsquo; said Ursula,
&lsquo;they are a bad set; and there is not a worse blackguard in
England than Anselo Herne.&rsquo; <a name="citation72"></a><a
href="#footnote72" class="citation">[72]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;All what you say may be very true, Ursula, but you
admit that there are half-and-halfs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more&rsquo;s the pity, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pity or not, you admit the fact; but how do you account
for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do I account for it?&nbsp; Why, I will tell you, by
the break up of a Roman family, brother&mdash;the father of a
small family dies, and perhaps the mother, and the poor children
are left behind, sometimes they are gathered up by their
relations, and sometimes, if they have none, by charitable
Romans, who bring them up in the observance of gypsy law; but
sometimes they are not so lucky, and falls into the company of
gorgios, trampers, and basket-makers, who live in caravans, with
whom they take up, and so&mdash;I hate to talk of the matter,
brother, but so comes this race of the half-and-halfs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you mean to say, Ursula, that no Romany chi,
unless compelled by hard necessity, would have anything to do
with a gorgio?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are not over fond of gorgios, brother, and we hates
basket-makers, and folks that live in caravans.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;suppose a gorgio, who is
not a basket-maker, a fine handsome gorgious gentleman, who lives
in a fine house&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are not fond of houses, brother, I never slept in a
house in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But would not plenty of money induce you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate houses, brother, and those who live in
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, suppose such a person were willing to resign his
fine house, and for love of you to adopt gypsy law, speak Romany,
and live in a tan, would you have nothing to say to
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&lsquo;Bringing plenty of money with him,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, bringing plenty of money with him,
Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother, suppose you produce your man; where is
he?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was merely supposing such a person,
Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know of such a person,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, no, Ursula; why do you ask?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, brother, I was almost beginning to think that
you meant yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Myself! Ursula; I have no fine house to resign; nor
have I money.&nbsp; Moreover, Ursula, though I have a great
regard for you, and though I consider you very handsome, quite as
handsome, indeed, as Meridiana in&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meridiana! where did you meet with her?&rsquo; said
Ursula, with a toss of her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why in old Pulci&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At old Fulcher&rsquo;s! that&rsquo;s not true,
brother.&nbsp; Meridiana is a Borzlam, <a
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> and travels with her own people, and
not with old Fulcher, <a name="citation73b"></a><a
href="#footnote73b" class="citation">[73b]</a> who is a gorgio,
and a basket-maker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not speaking of old Fulcher, but Pulci, a great
Italian writer, who lived many hundred years ago, and who, in his
poem called the &ldquo;Morgante Maggiore,&rdquo; speaks of
Meridiana, the daughter of&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Carus Borzlam,&rsquo; said Ursula; &lsquo;but if
the fellow you mention lived so many hundred years ago, how, in
the name of wonder, could he know anything of
Meridiana?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wonder, Ursula, is, how your people could ever have
got hold of that name, and similar ones.&nbsp; The Meridiana of
Pulci was not the daughter of old Carus Borzlam, but of Caradoro,
a great pagan king of the East, who, being besieged in his
capital by Manfredonio, another mighty pagan king, who wished to
obtain possession of his daughter, who had refused him, was
relieved in his distress by certain paladins of Charlemagne, with
one of whom, Oliver, his daughter Meridiana fell in
love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Ursula, &lsquo;that it must have
been altogether a different person, for I am sure that Meridiana
Borzlam would never have fallen in love with Oliver.&nbsp;
Oliver! why that is the name of the curo-mengro, <a
name="citation73c"></a><a href="#footnote73c"
class="citation">[73c]</a> who lost the <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>fight near
the chong gav, <a name="citation74a"></a><a href="#footnote74a"
class="citation">[74a]</a> the day of the great tempest, when I
got wet through. <a name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a>&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Meridiana Borzlam
would never have so far forgot her blood as to take up with Tom
Oliver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not talking of that Oliver, Ursula, but of
Oliver, peer of France, and paladin of Charlemagne, with whom
Meridiana, daughter of Caradoro, fell in love, and for whose sake
she renounced her religion and became a Christian, and finally
ingravidata, or cambri, by him:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;E nacquene un figliuol, dice la
storia,<br />
Che dette a Carlo-man poi gran vittoria:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what it means,&rsquo; said
Ursula; &lsquo;no good, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Well, if the
Meridiana of Charles&rsquo;s wain&rsquo;s pal was no handsomer
than Meridiana Borzlam, she was no great catch, brother; for
though I am by no means given to vanity, I think myself better to
look at than she, though I will say she is no lubbeny, and would
scorn&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I make no doubt she would, Ursula, and I make no doubt
that you are much handsomer than she, or even the Meridiana of
Oliver.&nbsp; What I was about to say, before you interrupted me,
is this, that though I have a great regard for you, and highly
admire you, it is only in a brotherly way, and&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you had nothing better to say to me,&rsquo; said
Ursula, &lsquo;when you wanted to talk to me beneath a hedge,
than that you liked me in a brotherly way! well, I
declare&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem disappointed, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Disappointed, brother! not I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were just now saying that you disliked gorgios, so,
of course, could only wish that I, who am a gorgio, should like
you in a brotherly way; I wished to have a conversation with you
beneath a hedge, but only with the view of procuring from you
some information respecting the song which you sung the other
day, and the conduct of Roman females, which has always struck me
as being highly unaccountable, so, if you thought anything
else&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What else should I expect from a picker-up of old <!--
page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>words, brother?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; I dislike a picker-up
of old words worse than a picker-up of old rags.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Ursula, I feel a great interest
in you; you are very handsome, and very clever; indeed, with your
beauty and cleverness, I only wonder that you have not long since
been married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do, do you, brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; However, keep up your spirits, Ursula, you
are not much past the prime of youth, so&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not much past the prime of youth!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
uncivil, brother, I was only twenty-two last month.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, Ursula, but twenty-two is
twenty-two, or, I should rather say, that twenty-two, in a woman
is more than twenty-six in a man.&nbsp; You are still very
beautiful, but I advise you to accept the first offer
that&rsquo;s made to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, brother, but your advice comes rather late;
I accepted the first offer that was made me five years
ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You married five years ago, Ursula! is it
possible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite possible, brother, I assure you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how came I to know nothing about it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How comes it that you don&rsquo;t know many thousand
things about the Romans, brother?&nbsp; Do you think they tell
you all their affairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married Ursula! married!&nbsp; Well, I
declare!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem disappointed, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Disappointed!&nbsp; Oh! no, not at all; but Jasper,
only a few weeks ago, told me that you were not married; and,
indeed, almost gave me to understand that you would be very glad
to get a husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you believed him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you,
brother, for your instruction, that there is not in the whole
world a greater liar than Jasper Petulengro.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to hear it, Ursula; but with respect to him
you married&mdash;who might he be?&nbsp; A gorgio, or a Romany
chal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gorgio, or Romany chal?&nbsp; Do you think I would ever
condescend to a gorgio?&nbsp; It was a Camomescro, <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a> brother, a Lovell, a distant relation
of my own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where is he, and what became of him?&nbsp; Have you
any family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am going to tell you all my
history, <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>brother; and, to tell you the truth,
I am tired of sitting under hedges with you, talking
nonsense.&nbsp; I shall go to my house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do sit a little longer, sister Ursula.&nbsp; I most
heartily congratulate you on your marriage.&nbsp; But where is
this same Lovell?&nbsp; I have never seen him: I should wish to
congratulate him, too.&nbsp; You are quite as handsome as the
Meridiana of Pulci, Ursula, ay, or the Despina of
Riciardetto.&nbsp; Riciardetto, Ursula, is a poem written by one
Fortiguerra, about ninety years ago, in imitation of the Morgante
of Pulci.&nbsp; It treats of the wars of Charlemagne and his
Paladins with various barbarous nations, who came to besiege
Paris.&nbsp; Despina was the daughter and heiress of Scricca,
King of Cafria; she was the beloved of Riciardetto, and was
beautiful as an angel; but I make no doubt you are quite as
handsome as she.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said Ursula&mdash;but the reply of
Ursula I reserve for another chapter, the present having attained
to rather an uncommon length, for which, however, the importance
of the matter discussed is a sufficient apology.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>URSULA&rsquo;S TALE&mdash;THE PATTERAN&mdash;THE DEEP
WATER&mdash;SECOND HUSBAND</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said Ursula, plucking a dandelion which
grew at her feet, &lsquo;I have always said that a more civil and
pleasant-spoken person than yourself can&rsquo;t be found.&nbsp;
I have a great regard for you and your learning, and am willing
to do you any pleasure in the way of words or conversation.&nbsp;
Mine is not a very happy story, but as you wish to hear it, it is
quite at your service.&nbsp; Launcelot Lovell made me an offer,
as you call it, and we were married in Roman fashion; that is, we
gave each other our right hands, and promised to be true to each
other.&nbsp; We lived together two years, travelling sometimes by
ourselves, sometimes with our relations; I bore him two children,
both of which were still-born, partly, I believe, from the
fatigue I underwent in running about the country telling dukkerin
when I was not exactly in a state to do so, and partly from the
kicks and blows which my husband, Launcelot, was in the habit of
giving me every <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>night, provided I came home with less
than five shillings, which it is sometimes impossible to make in
the country, provided no fair or merry-making is going on.&nbsp;
At the end of two years my husband, Launcelot, whistled a horse
from a farmer&rsquo;s field, and sold it for forty pounds; and
for that horse he was taken, put in prison, tried, and condemned
to be sent to the other country for life.&nbsp; Two days before
he was to be sent away, I got leave to see him in the prison, and
in the presence of the turnkey I gave him a thin cake of
gingerbread, in which there was a dainty saw which could cut
through iron.&nbsp; I then took on wonderfully, turned my eyes
inside out, fell down in a seeming fit, and was carried out of
the prison.&nbsp; That same night my husband sawed his irons off,
cut through the bars of his window, and dropping down a height of
fifty feet, lighted on his legs, and came and joined me on a
heath where I was camped alone.&nbsp; We were just getting things
ready to be off, when we heard people coming, and sure enough
they were runners after my husband, Launcelot Lovell; for his
escape had been discovered within a quarter of an hour after he
had got away.&nbsp; My husband, without bidding me farewell, set
off at full speed, and they after him, but they could not take
him, and so they came back and took me, and shook me, and
threatened me, and had me before the poknees, <a
name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a> who shook his head at me, and
threatened me in order to make me discover where my husband was,
but I said I did not know, which was true enough, not that I
would have told him if I had.&nbsp; So at last the poknees and
the runners, <a name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a> not being able to make anything out of
me, were obliged to let me go, and I went in search of my
husband.&nbsp; I wandered about with my cart for several days in
the direction in which I saw him run off, with my eyes bent on
the ground, but could see no marks of him; at last, coming to
four cross roads, I saw my husband&rsquo;s patteran.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You saw your husband&rsquo;s patteran?&rsquo; <a
name="citation77c"></a><a href="#footnote77c"
class="citation">[77c]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother.&nbsp; Do you know what patteran
means?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, Ursula; the gypsy trail, the handful of
grass which the gypsies strew in the roads as they travel, <!--
page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>to give information to any of their companions who may
be behind, as to the route they have taken.&nbsp; The gypsy
patteran has always had a strange interest for me,
Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like enough, brother; but what does patteran
mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, the gypsy trail, formed as I told you
before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you know nothing more about patteran,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing at all, Ursula; do you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the name for the leaf of a tree,
brother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
odd enough that I have asked that question of a dozen Romany
chals and chies, and they always told me that they did not
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No more they did, brother; there&rsquo;s only one
person in England that knows, and that&rsquo;s myself&mdash;the
name for a leaf is patteran.&nbsp; Now there are two that knows
it&mdash;the other is yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me, Ursula, how very strange!&nbsp; I am much
obliged to you.&nbsp; I think I never saw you look so pretty as
you do now; but who told you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother, Mrs. Herne, told it me one day, brother,
when she was in a good humour, which she very seldom was, as no
one has a better right to know than yourself, as she hated you
mortally: it was one day when you had been asking our company
what was the word for a leaf, and nobody could tell you, that she
took me aside and told me, for she was in a good humour, and
triumphed in seeing you balked.&nbsp; She told me the word for
leaf was patteran, which our people use now for trail, having
forgotten the true meaning.&nbsp; She said that the trail was
called patteran, because the gypsies of old were in the habit of
making the marks with the leaves and branches of the trees,
placed in a certain manner.&nbsp; She said that nobody knew it
but herself, who was one of the old sort, and begged me never to
tell the word to any one but him I should marry, and to be
particularly cautious never to let you know it, whom she
hated.&nbsp; Well, brother, perhaps I have done wrong to tell
you; but, as I said before, I likes you, and am always ready to
do your pleasure in words and conversation; my mother, moreover,
is dead and gone, and, poor thing, will never know anything about
the matter.&nbsp; So, when I married, I told my husband about the
patteran, and we were in the habit of making our private trail
with leaves and branches of <!-- page 79--><a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>trees, which
none of the other gypsy people did; so, when I saw my
husband&rsquo;s patteran, I knew it at once, and I followed it
upwards of two hundred miles towards the north; and then I came
to a deep, awful-looking water, with an overhanging bank, and on
the bank I found the patteran, which directed me to proceed along
the bank towards the east, and I followed my husband&rsquo;s
patteran towards the east; and before I had gone half a mile, I
came to a place where I saw the bank had given way, and fallen
into the deep water.&nbsp; Without paying much heed I passed on,
and presently came to a public-house, not far from the water, and
I entered the public-house to get a little beer, and perhaps to
tell a dukkerin, for I saw a great many people about the door;
and when I entered I found there was what they calls an inquest
being held upon a body in that house, and the jury had just risen
to go and look at the body, and being a woman, and having a
curiosity, I thought I would go with them, and so I did; and no
sooner did I see the body than I knew it to be my
husband&rsquo;s; it was much swelled and altered, but I knew it
partly by the clothes and partly by a mark on the forehead, and I
cried out, &ldquo;It is my husband&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; and I
fell down in a fit, and the fit that time, brother, was not a
seeming one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how terrible! but tell
me, Ursula, how did your husband come by his death?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bank, overhanging the deep water, gave way under
him, brother, and he was drowned; for, like most of our people,
he could not swim, or only a little.&nbsp; The body, after it had
been in the water a long time, came up of itself, and was found
floating.&nbsp; Well, brother, when the people of the
neighbourhood found that I was the wife of the drowned man, they
were very kind to me, and made a subscription for me, with which,
after having seen my husband buried, I returned the way I had
come, till I met Jasper and his people, and with them I have
travelled ever since: I was very melancholy for a long time, I
assure you, brother; for the death of my husband preyed very much
upon my mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His death was certainly a very shocking one, Ursula;
but, really, if he had died a natural one, you could scarcely
have regretted it, for he appears to have treated you
barbarously.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Women must bear, brother; and, barring that he <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>kicked and beat me, and drove me out to tell dukkerin
when I could scarcely stand, he was not a bad husband.&nbsp; A
man, by gypsy law, brother, is allowed to kick and beat his wife,
and to bury her alive, if he thinks proper.&nbsp; I am a gypsy,
and have nothing to say against the law.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what has Mikailia Chikno to say about
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a cripple, brother, the only cripple amongst the
Roman people: so she is allowed to do and say as she
pleases.&nbsp; Moreover, her husband does not think fit to kick
or beat her, though it is my opinion she would like him all the
better if he were occasionally to do so, and threaten to bury her
alive; at any rate, she would treat him better, and respect him
more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sister does not seem to stand much in awe of
Jasper Petulengro, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let the matters of my sister and Jasper Petulengro
alone, brother; you must travel in their company some time before
you can understand them; they are a strange two, up to all kind
of chaffing: but two more regular Romans don&rsquo;t breathe, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you, for your instruction, that there isn&rsquo;t
a better mare-breaker in England than Jasper Petulengro, if you
can manage Miss Isopel Berners as well as&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isopel Berners,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how came you to
think of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How should I but think of her, brother, living as she
does with you in Mumper&rsquo;s dingle, and travelling about with
you; you will have, brother, more difficulty to manage her, than
Jasper has to manage my sister Pakomovna.&nbsp; I should have
mentioned her before, only I wanted to know what you had to say
to me; and when we got into discourse, I forgot her.&nbsp; I say,
brother, let me tell you your dukkerin, with respect to her, you
will never&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do let me tell you your dukkerin, brother, you will
never manage&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula, in connection with
Isopel Berners.&nbsp; Moreover, it is Sunday, we will change the
subject; it is surprising to me that, after all you have
undergone, you should still look so beautiful.&nbsp; I suppose
you do not think of marrying again, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, brother, one husband at a time is quite enough <!--
page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>for any reasonable mort; especially such a good husband
as I have got.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such a good husband! why, I thought you told me your
husband was drowned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, brother, my first husband was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you a second?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is he? in the name of wonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is he?&nbsp; Why Sylvester, to be sure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do assure you, Ursula, that I feel disposed to be
angry with you; such a handsome young woman as yourself to take
up with such a nasty pepper-faced
good-for-nothing&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t hear my husband abused, brother; so you
had better say no more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, is he not the Lazarus of the gypsies?&nbsp; Has he
a penny of his own, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the more his want, brother, of a clever chi like
me to take care of him and his childer.&nbsp; I tell you what,
brother, I will chore, if necessary, and tell dukkerin for
Sylvester, if even so heavy as scarcely to be able to
stand.&nbsp; You call him lazy; you would not think him lazy if
you were in a ring with him; he is a proper man with his
hands.&nbsp; Jasper is going to back him for twenty pounds
against Slammocks of the Chong gav, the brother of Roarer and
Bell-metal.&nbsp; He says he has no doubt that he will
win.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you like him, I, of course, can have no
objection.&nbsp; Have you been long married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About a fortnight, brother; that dinner, the other day,
when I sang the song, was given in celebration of the
wedding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you married in a church, Ursula?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were not, brother; none but gorgios, cripples, and
lubbenys, are ever married in a church; <a
name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a> we took each other&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;
Brother, I have been with you near three hours beneath this
hedge.&nbsp; I will go to my husband.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he know that you are here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is he satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Satisfied! of course.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, you
gorgies!&nbsp; Brother, I <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>go to my
husband and my house.&rsquo;&nbsp; And, thereupon, Ursula rose
and departed.</p>
<p>After waiting a little time I also arose; it was now dark, and
I thought I could do no better than betake myself to the dingle;
at the entrance of it I found Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
brother,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what kind of conversation have
you and Ursula had beneath the hedge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you wished to hear what we were talking about, you
should have come and sat down beside us; you knew where we
were.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, brother, I did much the same, for I went and sat
down behind you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behind the hedge, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behind the hedge, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And heard all our conversation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every word, brother; and a rum conversation it
was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis an old saying, Jasper, that listeners never
hear any good of themselves; perhaps you heard the epithet that
Ursula bestowed upon you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If, by epitaph, you mean that she called me a liar, I
did, brother, and she was not much wrong, for I certainly do not
always stick exactly to truth; you, however, have not much to
complain of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You deceived me about Ursula, giving me to understand
she was not married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was not married when I told you so, brother; that
is, not to Sylvester; nor was I aware that she was going to marry
him.&nbsp; I once thought you had a kind of regard for her, and I
am sure she had as much for you as a Romany chi can have for a
gorgio.&nbsp; I half expected to have heard you make love to her
behind the hedge, but I begin to think you care for nothing in
this world but old words and strange stories.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;,
to take a young woman under a hedge, and talk to her as you did
to Ursula; and yet you got everything out of her that you wanted,
with your gammon about old Fulcher and Meridiana.&nbsp; You are a
cunning one, brother.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There you are mistaken, Jasper.&nbsp; I am not
cunning.&nbsp; If people think I am, it is because, being made up
of art themselves, simplicity of character is a puzzle to
them.&nbsp; Your women are certainly extraordinary creatures,
Jasper.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say they were rum animals?&nbsp;
Brother, we Romans shall always stick together as long as they
stick fast to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you think they always will, Jasper?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t say, brother; nothing lasts for ever.&nbsp;
Romany chies are Romany chies still, though not exactly what they
were sixty years ago.&nbsp; My wife, though a rum one, is not
Mrs. Herne, brother.&nbsp; I think she is rather fond of
Frenchmen and French discourse.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother,
if ever gypsyism breaks up, it will be owing to our chies having
been bitten by that mad puppy they calls gentility.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>THE DINGLE AT NIGHT&mdash;THE TWO SIDES OF THE
QUESTION&mdash;ROMAN FEMALES&mdash;FILLING THE KETTLE&mdash;THE
DREAM&mdash;THE TALL FIGURE</p>
<p>I descended to the bottom of the dingle.&nbsp; It was nearly
involved in obscurity.&nbsp; To dissipate the feeling of
melancholy which came over my mind, I resolved to kindle a fire;
and having heaped dry sticks upon my hearth, and added a billet
or two, I struck a light, and soon produced a blaze.&nbsp;
Sitting down, I fixed my eyes upon the blaze, and soon fell into
a deep meditation.&nbsp; I thought of the events of the day, the
scene at church, and what I had heard at church, the danger of
losing one&rsquo;s soul, the doubts of Jasper Petulengro as to
whether one had a soul.&nbsp; I thought over the various
arguments which I had either heard, or which had come
spontaneously to my mind, for or against the probability of a
state of future existence.&nbsp; They appeared to me to be
tolerably evenly balanced.&nbsp; I then thought that it was at
all events taking the safest part to conclude that there was a
soul.&nbsp; It would be a terrible thing, after having passed
one&rsquo;s life in the disbelief of the existence of a soul, to
wake up after death a soul, and to find one&rsquo;s self a lost
soul.&nbsp; Yes, methought I would come to the conclusion that
one has a soul.&nbsp; Choosing the safe side, however, appeared
to me playing rather a dastardly part.&nbsp; I had never been an
admirer of people who chose the safe side in everything; indeed I
had always entertained a thorough contempt for <!-- page 84--><a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>them.&nbsp;
Surely it would be showing more manhood to adopt the dangerous
side, that of disbelief.&nbsp; I almost resolved to do
so&mdash;but yet in a question of so much importance, I ought not
to be guided by vanity.&nbsp; The question was not which was the
safe, but the true side&mdash;yet how was I to know which was the
true side?&nbsp; Then I thought of the Bible&mdash;which I had
been reading in the morning&mdash;that spoke of the soul and a
future state; but was the Bible true?&nbsp; I had heard learned
and moral men say that it was true, but I had also heard learned
and moral men say that it was not: how was I to decide?&nbsp;
Still that balance of probabilities!&nbsp; If I could but see the
way of truth, I would follow it, if necessary, upon hands and
knees&mdash;on that I was determined; but I could not see
it.&nbsp; Feeling my brain begin to turn round, I resolved to
think of something else; and forthwith began to think of what had
passed between Ursula and myself in our discourse beneath the
hedge.</p>
<p>I mused deeply on what she had told me as to the virtue of the
females of her race.&nbsp; How singular that virtue must be which
was kept pure and immaculate by the possessor, whilst indulging
in habits of falsehood and dishonesty!&nbsp; I had always thought
the gypsy females extraordinary beings.&nbsp; I had often
wondered at them, their dress, their manner of speaking, and, not
least, at their names; but, until the present day, I had been
unacquainted with the most extraordinary point connected with
them.&nbsp; How came they possessed of this extraordinary
virtue?&nbsp; Was it because they were thievish?&nbsp; I
remembered that an ancient thief-taker, who had retired from his
useful calling, and who frequently visited the office of my
master at law, the respectable S---, <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a> who had the
management of his property&mdash;I remembered to have heard this
worthy, with whom I occasionally held discourse, philosophic and
profound, when he and I chanced to be alone together in the
office, say that all first-rate thieves were sober, and of
well-regulated morals, their bodily passions being kept in
abeyance by their love of gain; but this axiom could scarcely
hold good with respect to these women&mdash;however thievish they
might be, they did care for something besides gain: they cared
for their husbands.&nbsp; If they did thieve, they merely thieved
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>for their husbands; and though, perhaps, some of them
were vain, they merely prized their beauty because it gave them
favour in the eyes of their husbands.&nbsp; Whatever the husbands
were&mdash;and Jasper had almost insinuated that the males
occasionally allowed themselves some latitude&mdash;they appeared
to be as faithful to their husbands as the ancient Roman matrons
were to theirs.&nbsp; Roman matrons! and, after all, might not
these be in reality Roman matrons?&nbsp; They called themselves
Romans; might not they be the descendants of the old Roman
matrons?&nbsp; Might not they be of the same blood as
Lucretia?&nbsp; And were not many of their strange
names&mdash;Lucretia amongst the rest&mdash;handed down to them
from old Rome?&nbsp; It is true their language was not that of
old Rome; it was not, however, altogether different from
it.&nbsp; After all, the ancient Romans might be a tribe of these
people, who settled down and founded a village with the tilts of
carts, which by degrees, and the influx of other people, became
the grand city of the world.&nbsp; I liked the idea of the grand
city of the world owing its origin to a people who had been in
the habit of carrying their houses in their carts.&nbsp; Why,
after all, should not the Romans of history be a branch of these
Romans?&nbsp; There were several points of similarity between
them; if Roman matrons were chaste, both men and women were
thieves.&nbsp; Old Rome was the thief of the world; yet still
there were difficulties to be removed before I could persuade
myself that the old Romans and my Romans were identical; and in
trying to remove these difficulties, I felt my brain once more
beginning to turn, and in haste took up another subject of
meditation, and that was the patteran, and what Ursula had told
me about it.</p>
<p>I had always entertained a strange interest for that sign by
which in their wanderings the Romanese gave to those of their
people who came behind intimation as to the direction which they
took; but it now inspired me with greater interest than
ever&mdash;now that I had learnt that the proper meaning of it
was the leaves of trees.&nbsp; I had, as I have said in my
dialogue with Ursula, been very eager to learn the word for leaf
in the Romanian language, but had never learnt it till this day;
so patteran signified leaf, the leaf of a tree; and no one at
present knew that but myself and Ursula, who had learnt it from
Mrs. Herne, the last, it was said, of the old stock; and then I
thought <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>what strange people the gypsies must
have been in the old time.&nbsp; They were sufficiently strange
at present, but they must have been far stranger of old; they
must have been a more peculiar people&mdash;their language must
have been more perfect&mdash;and they must have had a greater
stock of strange secrets.&nbsp; I almost wish that I had lived
some two or three hundred years ago, that I might have observed
these people when they were yet stranger than at present.&nbsp; I
wondered whether I could have introduced myself to their company
at that period, whether I should have been so fortunate as to
meet such a strange, half-malicious, half good-humoured being as
Jasper, who would have instructed me in the language, then more
deserving of note than at present.&nbsp; What might I not have
done with that language, had I known it in its purity?&nbsp; Why,
I might have written books in it; yet those who spoke it would
hardly have admitted me to their society at that period, when
they kept more to themselves.&nbsp; Yet I thought that I might
possibly have gained their confidence, and have wandered about
with them, and learnt their language, and all their strange ways,
and then&mdash;and then&mdash;and a sigh rose from the depth of
my breast; for I began to think, &lsquo;Supposing I had
accomplished all this, what would have been the profit of it? and
in what would all this wild gypsy dream have
terminated?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then rose another sigh, yet more profound, for I began to
think, &lsquo;What was likely to be the profit of my present way
of life; the living in dingles, making pony and donkey shoes,
conversing with gypsy-women under hedges, and extracting from
them their odd secrets?&rsquo;&nbsp; What was likely to be the
profit of such a kind of life, even should it continue for a
length of time?&mdash;a supposition not very probable, for I was
earning nothing to support me, and the funds with which I had
entered upon this life were gradually disappearing.&nbsp; I was
living, it is true, not unpleasantly, enjoying the healthy air of
heaven; but, upon the whole, was I not sadly misspending my
time?&nbsp; Surely I was; and, as I looked back, it appeared to
me that I had always been doing so.&nbsp; What had been the
profit of the tongues which I had learnt? had they ever assisted
me in the day of hunger?&nbsp; No, no! it appeared to me that I
had always misspent my time, save in one instance, when by a
desperate effort I had collected all the powers of my
imagination, and written the Life of <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Joseph Sell;
<a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a> but even when I wrote the life of Sell,
was I not in a false position?&nbsp; Provided I had not misspent
my time, would it have been necessary to make that effort, which,
after all, had only enabled me to leave London, and wander about
the country for a time?&nbsp; But could I, taking all
circumstances into consideration, have done better than I
had?&nbsp; With my peculiar temperament and ideas, could I have
pursued with advantage the profession to which my respectable
parents had endeavoured to bring me up?&nbsp; It appeared to me
that I could not, and that the hand of necessity had guided me
from my earliest years, until the present night in which I found
myself seated in the dingle, staring on the brands of the
fire.&nbsp; But ceasing to think of the past which, as
irrecoverably gone, it was useless to regret, even were there
cause to regret it, what should I do in future?&nbsp; Should I
write another book like the Life of Joseph Sell; take it to
London, and offer it to a publisher?&nbsp; But when I reflected
on the grisly sufferings which I had undergone whilst engaged in
writing the Life of Sell, I shrank from the idea of a similar
attempt; moreover, I doubted whether I possessed the power to
write a similar work&mdash;whether the materials for the life of
another Sell lurked within the recesses of my brain?&nbsp; Had I
not better become in reality what I had hitherto been merely
playing at&mdash;a tinker or a gypsy?&nbsp; But I soon saw that I
was not fitted to become either in reality.&nbsp; It was much
more agreeable to play the gypsy or the tinker, than to become
either in reality.&nbsp; I had seen enough of gypsying and
tinkering to be convinced of that.&nbsp; All of a sudden the idea
of tilling the soil came into my head; tilling the soil was a
healthful and noble pursuit! but my idea of tilling the soil had
no connection with Britain; for I could only expect to till the
soil in Britain as a serf.&nbsp; I thought of tilling it in
America, in which it was said there was plenty of wild, unclaimed
land, of which any one, who chose to clear it of its trees, might
take possession.&nbsp; I figured myself in America, in an immense
forest, clearing the land destined, by my exertions, to become a
fruitful and smiling plain.&nbsp; Methought I heard the crash of
the huge trees as they fell beneath my axe; and then I bethought
me that a man was intended to marry&mdash;I ought to marry; and
if I married, where was I likely to be more <!-- page 88--><a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>happy as a
husband and a father than in America, engaged in tilling the
ground?&nbsp; I fancied myself in America, engaged in tilling the
ground, assisted by an enormous progeny.&nbsp; Well, why not
marry, and go and till the ground in America?&nbsp; I was young,
and youth was the time to marry in, and to labour in.&nbsp; I had
the use of all my faculties; my eyes, it is true, were rather
dull from early study, and from writing the Life of Joseph Sell;
but I could see tolerably well with them, and they were not
bleared.&nbsp; I felt my arms, and thighs, and teeth&mdash;they
were strong and sound enough; so now was the time to labour, to
marry, eat strong flesh, and beget strong children&mdash;the
power of doing all this would pass away with youth, which was
terribly transitory.&nbsp; I bethought me that a time would come
when my eyes would be bleared, and, perhaps, sightless; my arms
and thighs strengthless and sapless; when my teeth would shake in
my jaws, even supposing they did not drop out.&nbsp; No going a
wooing then&mdash;no labouring&mdash;no eating strong flesh, and
begetting lusty children then; and I bethought me how, when all
this should be, I should bewail the days of my youth as misspent,
provided I had not in them founded for myself a home, and
begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when I
could not take care of myself; and thinking of these things, I
became sadder and sadder, and stared vacantly upon the fire till
my eyes closed in a doze.</p>
<p>I continued dozing over the fire, until rousing myself I
perceived that the brands were nearly consumed, and I thought of
retiring for the night.&nbsp; I arose, and was about to enter my
tent, when a thought struck me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose,&rsquo;
thought I, &lsquo;that Isopel Berners should return in the midst
of the night, how dark and dreary would the dingle appear without
a fire! truly, I will keep up the fire, and I will do more; I
have no board to spread for her, but I will fill the kettle, and
heat it, so that, if she comes, I may be able to welcome her with
a cup of tea, for I know she loves tea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon, I
piled more wood upon the fire, and soon succeeded in producing a
better blaze than before; then, taking the kettle, I set out for
the spring.&nbsp; On arriving at the mouth of the dingle, which
fronted the east, I perceived that Charles&rsquo;s wain was
nearly opposite to it, high above in the heavens, by which I knew
that the night was tolerably well advanced.&nbsp; The gypsy
encampment lay before me; all was hushed <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>and still
within it, and its inmates appeared to be locked in slumber; as I
advanced, however, the dogs, which were fastened outside the
tents, growled and barked; but presently recognising me, they
were again silent, some of them wagging their tails.&nbsp; As I
drew near a particular tent, I heard a female voice
say&mdash;&lsquo;Some one is coming!&rsquo; and, as I was about
to pass it, the cloth which formed the door was suddenly lifted
up, and a black head, and part of a huge naked body
protruded.&nbsp; It was the head and upper part of the giant
Tawno, who, according to the fashion of gypsy men, lay next the
door, wrapped in his blanket; the blanket, had, however, fallen
off, and the starlight shone clear on his athletic tawny body,
and was reflected from his large staring eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only I, Tawno,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;going to
fill the kettle, as it is possible that Miss Berners may arrive
this night.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Kos-ko,&rsquo; <a
name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a> drawled out Tawno, and replaced the
curtain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good, do you call it?&rsquo; said the sharp
voice of his wife; &lsquo;there is no good in the matter; if that
young chap were not living with the rawnee in the illegal and
uncertificated line, he would not be getting up in the middle of
the night to fill her kettles.&rsquo;&nbsp; Passing on, I
proceeded to the spring, where I filled the kettle, and then
returned to the dingle.</p>
<p>Placing the kettle upon the fire, I watched it till it began
to boil; then removing it from the top of the brands, I placed it
close beside the fire, and leaving it simmering, I retired to my
tent, where, having taken off my shoes, and a few of my garments,
I lay down on my palliasse, and was not long in falling
asleep.&nbsp; I believe I slept soundly for some time, thinking
and dreaming of nothing; suddenly, however, my sleep became
disturbed, and the subject of the patterans began to occupy my
brain.&nbsp; I imagined that I saw Ursula tracing her husband,
Launcelot Lovell, by means of his patterans; I imagined that she
had considerable difficulty in doing so; that she was
occasionally interrupted by parish beadles and constables, who
asked her whither she was travelling, to whom she gave various
answers.&nbsp; Presently methought that, as she was passing by a
farmyard, two fierce and savage dogs flew at her; I was in great
trouble, I remember, and wished to assist her, but could not, for
though I seemed to see her, I was still at a distance; and now it
appeared that she had escaped from the dogs, and <!-- page
90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>was
proceeding with her cart along a gravelly path which traversed a
wild moor; I could hear the wheels grating amidst sand and
gravel.&nbsp; The next moment I was awake, and found myself
silting up in my tent; there was a glimmer of light through the
canvas caused by the fire.&nbsp; A feeling of dread came over me,
which was perhaps natural on starting suddenly from one&rsquo;s
sleep in that wild lone place; I half imagined that someone was
nigh the tent; the idea made me rather uncomfortable, and, to
dissipate it, I lifted up the canvas of the door and peeped out,
and, lo! I had an indistinct view of a tall figure standing by
the tent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo; said I, whilst I felt
my blood rush to my heart.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; said the
voice of Isopel Berners; &lsquo;you little expected me, I dare
say; well, sleep on, I do not wish to disturb you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I was expecting you,&rsquo; said I, recovering myself,
&lsquo;as you may see by the fire and the kettle.&nbsp; I will be
with you in a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Putting on in haste the articles of dress which I had flung
off, I came out of the tent, and addressing myself to Isopel, who
was standing beside her cart, I said: &lsquo;Just as I was about
to retire to rest I thought it possible that you might come
to-night, and got everything in readiness for you.&nbsp; Now, sit
down by the fire whilst I lead the donkey and cart to the place
where you stay; I will unharness the animal, and presently come
and join you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I need not trouble you,&rsquo;
said Isopel; &lsquo;I will go myself and see after my
things.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We will go together,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and then return and have some tea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Isopel
made no objection, and in about half an hour we had arranged
everything at her quarters.&nbsp; I then hastened and prepared
tea.&nbsp; Presently Isopel rejoined me, bringing her stool; she
had divested herself of her bonnet, and her hair fell over her
shoulders; she sat down, and I poured out the beverage, handing
her a cup.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you made a long journey
to-night?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;A very long one,&rsquo;
replied Belle, &lsquo;I have come nearly twenty miles since six
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe I heard you coming
in my sleep,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;did the dogs above bark at
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Isopel, &lsquo;very
violently; did you think of me in your sleep?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I was thinking of Ursula and
something she had told me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;When and where was
that?&rsquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yesterday evening,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;beneath the dingle hedge.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then
you were talking with her beneath the hedge?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I was,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but only upon gypsy
matters.&nbsp; Do <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>you know, Belle, that she has just
been married to Sylvester, so you need not think that she and
I&mdash;.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She and you are quite at liberty to
sit where you please,&rsquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; &lsquo;However,
young man,&rsquo; she continued, dropping her tone, which she had
slightly raised, &lsquo;I believe what you said, that you were
merely talking about gypsy matters, and also what you were going
to say, if it was, as I suppose, that she and you had no
particular acquaintance.&rsquo;&nbsp; Isopel was now silent for
some time.&nbsp; &lsquo;What are you thinking of?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;how
exceedingly kind it was of you to get everything in readiness for
me, though you did not know that I should come.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had a presentiment that you would come,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;but you forget that I have prepared the kettle for you
before, though it was true I was then certain that you would
come.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I had not forgotten your doing so,
young man,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;but I was beginning to think
that you were utterly selfish, caring for nothing but the
gratification of your own strange whims.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
very fond of having my own way,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but utterly
selfish I am not, as I dare say I shall frequently prove to
you.&nbsp; You will often find the kettle boiling when you come
home.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not heated by you,&rsquo; said Isopel
with a sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;By whom else?&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;surely you are not thinking of driving me
away?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You have as much right here as
myself,&rsquo; said Isopel, &lsquo;as I have told you before; but
I must be going myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;we can go together; to tell you the truth, I am rather
tired of this place.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Our paths must be
separate,&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Separate,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;what do you mean?&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let you go
alone, I shall go with you; and you know the road is as free to
me as to you; besides, you can&rsquo;t think of parting company
with me, considering how much you would lose by doing so;
remember that you scarcely know anything of the Armenian
language; now, to learn Armenian from me would take you twenty
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Belle faintly smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;take another cup of tea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle took another
cup of tea, and yet another; we had some indifferent
conversation, after which I arose and gave her donkey a
considerable feed of corn.&nbsp; Belle thanked me, shook me by
the hand, and then went to her own tabernacle, and I returned to
mine.</p>

92</span>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>VISIT TO THE LANDLORD&mdash;HIS MORTIFICATIONS&mdash;HUNTER
AND HIS CLAN&mdash;RESOLUTION</p>
<p>On the following morning, after breakfasting with Belle, who
was silent and melancholy, I left her in the dingle, and took a
stroll amongst the neighbouring lanes.&nbsp; After some time I
thought I would pay a visit to the landlord of the public house,
whom I had not seen since the day when he communicated to me his
intention of changing his religion.&nbsp; I therefore directed my
steps to the house, and on entering it found the landlord
standing in the kitchen.&nbsp; Just then two mean-looking
fellows, who had been drinking at one of the tables, and who
appeared to be the only customers in the house, got up, brushed
past the landlord, and saying in a surly tone, &lsquo;We shall
pay you some time or other,&rsquo; took their departure.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way they serve me now,&rsquo; said the
landlord, with a sigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know those
fellows,&rsquo; I demanded, &lsquo;since you let them go away in
your debt?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know nothing about them,&rsquo;
said the landlord, &lsquo;save that they are a couple of
scamps.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then why did you let them go away
without paying you?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I had not the
heart to stop them,&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;and, to tell
you the truth, everybody serves me so now, and I suppose they are
right, for a child could flog me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;behave more like a man,
and with respect to those two fellows run after them, I will go
with you, and if they refuse to pay the reckoning I will help you
to shake some money out of their clothes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;but as they
are gone, let them go on.&nbsp; What they have drank is not of
much consequence.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the matter with
you?&rsquo; said I, staring at the landlord, who appeared
strangely altered; his features were wild and haggard, his
formerly bluff cheeks were considerably sunken in, and his figure
had lost much of its plumpness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you changed
your religion already, and has the fellow in black commanded you
to fast?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have not changed my religion
yet,&rsquo; said the landlord, with a kind of shudder; &lsquo;I
am to change it publicly this day fortnight, and the idea of
doing so&mdash;I do not mind telling you&mdash;preys much upon my
mind; moreover, the noise <!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>of the thing
has got abroad, and everybody is laughing at me, and what&rsquo;s
more, coming and drinking my beer, and going away without paying
for it, whilst I feel myself like one bewitched, wishing but not
daring to take my own part.&nbsp; Confound the fellow in black, I
wish I had never seen him! yet what can I do without him?&nbsp;
The brewer swears that unless I pay him fifty pounds within a
fortnight he&rsquo;ll send a distress warrant into the house, and
take all I have.&nbsp; My poor niece is crying in the room above;
and I am thinking of going into the stable and hanging myself;
and perhaps it&rsquo;s the best thing I can do, for it&rsquo;s
better to hang myself before selling my soul than afterwards, as
I&rsquo;m sure I should, like Judas Iscariot, whom my poor niece,
who is somewhat religiously inclined, has been talking to me
about.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I could assist you,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;with money, but that is quite out of my power.&nbsp;
However, I can give you a piece of advice.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
change your religion by any means; you can&rsquo;t hope to
prosper if you do; and if the brewer chooses to deal hardly with
you, let him.&nbsp; Everybody would respect you ten times more
provided you allowed yourself to be turned into the roads rather
than change your religion, than if you got fifty pounds for
renouncing it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am half inclined to take
your advice,&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;only, to tell you
the truth, I feel quite low, without any heart in
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Come into the bar,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and let us have something together&mdash;you need not be
afraid of my not paying for what I order.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We went into the bar-room, where the landlord and I discussed
between us two bottles of strong ale, which he said were part of
the last six which he had in his possession.&nbsp; At first he
wished to drink sherry, but I begged him to do no such thing,
telling him that sherry would do him no good, under the present
circumstances; nor, indeed, to the best of my belief under any,
it being of all wines the one for which I entertained the most
contempt.&nbsp; The landlord allowed himself to be dissuaded,
and, after a glass or two of ale, confessed that sherry was a
sickly disagreeable drink, and that he had merely been in the
habit of taking it from an idea he had that it was genteel.&nbsp;
Whilst quaffing our beverage, he gave me an account of the
various mortifications to which he had of late been subject,
dwelling with particular bitterness on the conduct <!-- page
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>of
Hunter, who he said came every night and mouthed him, and
afterwards went away without paying for what he had drank or
smoked, in which conduct he was closely imitated by a clan of
fellows who constantly attended him.&nbsp; After spending several
hours at the public-house I departed, not forgetting to pay for
the two bottles of ale.&nbsp; The landlord, before I went,
shaking me by the hand, declared that he had now made up his mind
to stick to his religion at all hazards, the more especially as
he was convinced he should derive no good by giving it up.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>PREPARATIONS FOR THE FAIR&mdash;THE LAST LESSON&mdash;THE VERB
SIRIEL</p>
<p>It might be about five in the evening when I reached the gypsy
encampment.&nbsp; Here I found Mr. Petulengro, Tawno Chickno,
Sylvester, and others, in a great bustle, clipping and trimming
certain ponies and old horses which they had brought with
them.&nbsp; On inquiring of Jasper the reason of their being so
engaged, he informed me that they were getting the horses ready
for a fair, which was to be held on the morrow, at a place some
miles distant, at which they should endeavour to dispose of them,
adding&mdash;&lsquo;Perhaps, brother, you will go with us,
provided you have nothing better to do?&rsquo;&nbsp; Not having
any particular engagement, I assured him that I should have great
pleasure in being of the party.&nbsp; It was agreed that we
should start early on the following morning.&nbsp; Thereupon I
descended into the dingle.&nbsp; Belle was sitting before the
fire, at which the kettle was boiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were you
waiting for me?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said
Belle, &lsquo;I thought that you would come, and I waited for
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That was very kind,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not half so kind,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;as it was of you
to get everything ready for me in the dead of last night, when
there was scarcely a chance of my coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
tea-things were brought forward, and we sat down.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you been far?&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Merely
to that public-house,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to which you directed
me on the second day of our acquaintance.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Young men should not make a habit of visiting
public-houses,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;they are bad
places.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;They may be <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>so to some
people,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but I do not think the worst
public-house in England could do me any harm.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps you are so bad already,&rsquo; said Belle, with a
smile, &lsquo;that it would be impossible to spoil
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How dare you catch at my words?&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;come, I will make you pay for doing so&mdash;you
shall have this evening the longest lesson in Armenian which I
have yet inflicted upon you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You may well say
inflicted,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;but pray spare me.&nbsp; I
do not wish to hear anything about Armenian, especially this
evening.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why this evening?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; Belle made no answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will not spare
you,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;this evening I intend to make you
conjugate an Armenian verb.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, be it
so,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;for this evening you shall
command.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;To command is hramahyel,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ram her ill, indeed,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;I
do not wish to begin with that.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;as we have come to the verbs, we will begin
regularly; hramahyel is a verb of the second conjugation.&nbsp;
We will begin with the first.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;First of all
tell me,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;what a verb is?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;A part of speech,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;which, according
to the dictionary, signifies some action or passion&mdash;for
example, I command you, or I hate you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
given you no cause to hate me,&rsquo; said Belle, looking me
sorrowfully in the face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was merely giving two examples,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and neither was directed at you.&nbsp; In those examples,
to command and hate are verbs.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian there are
four conjugations of verbs; the first end in el, the second in
yel, the third in oul, and the fourth in il.&nbsp; Now, have you
understood me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid, indeed, it will all end ill,&rsquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold your tongue,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or
you will make me lose my patience.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You have
already made me nearly lose mine,&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let us have no unprofitable interruptions,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;The conjugations of the Armenian verbs are
neither so numerous nor so difficult as the declensions of the
nouns; hear that, and rejoice.&nbsp; Come, we will begin with the
verb hntal, a verb of the first conjugation, which signifies to
rejoice.&nbsp; Come along; hntam, I rejoice; hntas, thou
rejoicest: why don&rsquo;t you follow, Belle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t rejoice, whatever you may
do,&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;The chief difficulty,
Belle,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that I find in teaching you the
Armenian grammar, proceeds from your applying to yourself and me
every example I give.&nbsp; <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Rejoice, in
this instance, is merely an example of an Armenian verb of the
first conjugation, and has no more to do with your rejoicing than
lal, which is also a verb of the first conjugation, and which
signifies to weep, would have to do with your weeping, provided I
made you conjugate it.&nbsp; Come along; hntam, I rejoice; hntas,
thou rejoicest, hnt&agrave;, he rejoices; hntamk, we rejoice:
now, repeat those words.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;they sound
more like the language of horses than of human beings.&nbsp; Do
you take me for&mdash;?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;For what?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; Belle was silent.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were you going to say
mare?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mare! mare! by-the-by, do you
know, Belle, that mare in old English stands for woman; and that
when we call a female an evil mare, the strict meaning of the
term is merely bad woman.&nbsp; So if I were to call you mare,
without prefixing bad, you must not be offended.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I should, though,&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
was merely attempting to make you acquainted with a philological
fact,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;If mare, which in old English,
and likewise in vulgar English, signifies a woman, sounds the
same as mare, which in modern and polite English signifies a
female horse, I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; There is no confusion
of sounds in Armenian, not, at least, in the same instance.&nbsp;
Belle, in Armenian, woman is ghin, the same word, by-the-by, a
sour queen, whereas mare is madagh tzi, which signifies a female
horse; and perhaps you will permit me to add that a hard-mouthed
jade is, in Armenian, madagh tzi hsdierah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this much longer,&rsquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Keep yourself quiet,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I
wish to be gentle with you; and to convince you, we will skip
hntal, and also for the present verbs of the first conjugation,
and proceed to the second.&nbsp; Belle, I will now select for you
to conjugate the prettiest verb in Armenian; not only of the
second, but also of all the four conjugations; that verb is
siriel.&nbsp; Here is the present tense: siriem, siries,
sir&egrave;, siriemk, sir&egrave;k, sirien.&nbsp; You observe
that it runs on just in the same manner as hntal, save and except
that e is substituted for a; and it will be as well to tell you
that almost the only difference between the second, third, and
fourth conjugations, and the first, is the substituting in the
present, preterite, and other tenses, e, or ou, or i for a; so
you see that the Armenian verbs are by no means <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>difficult.&nbsp; Come on, Belle, and say
siriem.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle hesitated.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray oblige
me, Belle, by saying siriem!&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle still appeared to
hesitate.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must admit, Belle, that it is much
softer than hntam.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is so,&rsquo; said
Belle; &lsquo;and to oblige you, I will say siriem.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Very well indeed, Belle,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
vartabied, or doctor, could have pronounced it better; and now,
to show you how verbs act upon pronouns in Armenian, I will say
siriem zkiez.&nbsp; Please to repeat siriem zkiez!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Siriem zkiez!&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;that last word is
very hard to say.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sorry that you think so,
Belle,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now please to say siri&aacute;
zis.&rsquo;&nbsp; Belle did so.&nbsp; &lsquo;Exceedingly
well,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now say yerani th&egrave;
sir&egrave;ir zis.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yerani th&egrave;
sir&egrave;ir zis,&rsquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Capital!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you have now said, I love
you&mdash;love me&mdash;ah! would that you would love
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I have said all these things?&rsquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you have said them
in Armenian.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I would have said them in no
language that I understood,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;and it was
very wrong of you to take advantage of my ignorance, and make me
say such things.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;if you said them, I said them too.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You
did so,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;but I believe you were merely
bantering and jeering.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;As I told you before,
Belle,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the chief difficulty which I find in
teaching you Armenian proceeds from your persisting in applying
to yourself and me every example I give.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then
you meant nothing after all?&rsquo; said Belle, raising her
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let us proceed,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;sirietsi, I loved.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You never loved any
one but yourself,&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;and what&rsquo;s
more&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sirietsits, I will love,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;siriestsies, thou wilt love.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never one so thoroughly heartless,&rsquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell you what, Belle, you are becoming
intolerable; but we will change the verb, or rather I will now
proceed to tell you here, that some of the Armenian conjugations
have their anomalies; one species of these I wish to bring before
your notice.&nbsp; As old Villotte <a name="citation97"></a><a
href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a> says&mdash;from
whose work I first contrived to pick up the rudiments of
Armenian&mdash;&ldquo;Est verborum transitivorum, quorum
infinitivus&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But I forgot, you don&rsquo;t
understand Latin.&nbsp; He says there are certain transitive
verbs, whose infinitive is in out-saniel; the preterite in outsi;
the imperative in oue: for example, parghatsoutsaniem, I
irritate&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&lsquo;You do, you do!&rsquo; said Belle; &lsquo;and it
will be better for both of us, if you leave off doing
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would hardly believe, Belle,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;that the Armenian is in some respects closely connected
with the Irish, but so it is; for example, that word
parghatsoutsaniem is evidently derived from the same root as
feargaim, which, in Irish, is as much as to say I vex.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do, indeed!&rsquo; said Belle, sobbing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how do you account for it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O man, man!&rsquo; said Belle, bursting into tears,
&lsquo;for what purpose do you ask a poor ignorant girl such a
question, unless it be to vex and irritate her?&nbsp; If you wish
to display your learning, do so to the wise and instructed, and
not to me, who can scarcely read or write.&nbsp; Oh, leave off
your nonsense; yet I know you will not do so, for it is the
breath of your nostrils!&nbsp; I could have wished we should have
parted in kindness, but you will not permit it.&nbsp; I have
deserved better at your hands than such treatment.&nbsp; The
whole time we have kept company together in this place, I have
scarcely had one kind word from you, but the
strangest&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; And here the voice of Belle was
drowned in her sobs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry to see you take on so, dear Belle,&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I really have given you no cause to be so
unhappy.&nbsp; Surely teaching you a little Armenian was a very
innocent kind of diversion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but you went on so long, and in such a strange
way, and made me repeat such strange examples, as you call them,
that I could not bear it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Belle, it&rsquo;s my way;
and I have dealt with you just as I would with&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hard-mouthed jade,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;and you
practising your horse-witchery upon her.&nbsp; I have been of an
unsubdued spirit, I acknowledge, but I was always kind to you;
and if you have made me cry, it&rsquo;s a poor thing to boast
of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Boast of!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;a pretty thing indeed
to boast of; I had no idea of making you cry.&nbsp; Come, I beg
your pardon: what more can I do?&nbsp; Come, cheer up,
Belle.&nbsp; You were talking of parting; don&rsquo;t let us
part, but depart, and that together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our ways lie different,&rsquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they should,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, let us be off to America together.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&lsquo;To America together?&rsquo; said Belle, looking
full at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;where we will settle down in
some forest, and conjugate the verb siriel conjugally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conjugally?&rsquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;as man and wife in America,
air yew ghin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are jesting as usual,&rsquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I, indeed.&nbsp; Come, Belle, make up your mind,
and let us be off to America; and leave priests, humbug,
learning, and languages behind us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are jesting,&rsquo; said Belle;
&lsquo;but I can hardly entertain your offers.&nbsp; However,
young man, I thank you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better make up your mind at once,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;and let us be off.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t make a bad
husband, I assure you.&nbsp; Perhaps you think I am not worthy of
you?&nbsp; To convince you, Belle, that I am, I am ready to try a
fall with you this moment upon the grass.&nbsp; Brynhilda, the
valkyrie, swore that no one should marry her who could not fling
her down.&nbsp; Perhaps you have done the same.&nbsp; The man who
eventually married her, got a friend of his, who was called
Sygurd, the serpent-killer, to wrestle with her, disguising him
in his own armour.&nbsp; Sygurd flung her down, and won her for
his friend, though he loved her himself.&nbsp; I shall not use a
similar deceit, nor employ Jasper Petulengro to personate
me&mdash;so get up, Belle, and I will do my best to fling you
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I require no such thing of you, or anybody,&rsquo; said
Belle; &lsquo;you are beginning to look rather wild.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I every now and then do,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, Belle, what do you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will say nothing at present on the subject,&rsquo;
said Belle; &lsquo;I must have time to consider.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just as you please,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to-morrow I
go to a fair with Mr. Petulengro&mdash;perhaps you will consider
whilst I am away.&nbsp; Come, Belle, let us have some more
tea.&nbsp; I wonder whether we shall be able to procure tea as
good as this in the American forest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>THE DAWN OF DAY&mdash;THE LAST FAREWELL&mdash;DEPARTURE FOR
THE FAIR&mdash;THE FINE HORSE&mdash;RETURN TO THE DINGLE&mdash;NO
ISOPEL</p>
<p>It was about the dawn of day when I was awakened by the voice
of Mr. Petulengro shouting from the top of the dingle, and
bidding me get up.&nbsp; I arose instantly, and dressed myself
for the expedition to the fair.&nbsp; On leaving my tent, I was
surprised to observe Belle, entirely dressed, standing close to
her own little encampment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I little expected to find you up so early.&nbsp; I suppose
Jasper&rsquo;s call awakened you, as it did me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I merely lay down in my things,&rsquo; said Belle,
&lsquo;and have not slept during the night.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And why did you not take off your things and go to
sleep?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did not undress,&rsquo; said
Belle, &lsquo;because I wished to be in readiness to bid you
farewell when you departed; and as for sleeping I could
not.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, God bless you!&rsquo; said I,
taking Belle by the hand.&nbsp; Belle made no answer, and I
observed that her hand was very cold.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the
matter with you?&rsquo; said I, looking her in the face.&nbsp;
Belle looked at me for a moment in the eyes, and then cast down
her own&mdash;her features were very pale.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are
really unwell,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I had better not go to the
fair, but stay here, and take care of you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Belle, &lsquo;pray go, I am not
unwell.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then go to your tent,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and do not endanger your health by standing abroad in the
raw morning air.&nbsp; God bless you, Belle, I shall be home
to-night, by which time I expect you will have made up your mind,
if not, another lesson in Armenian, however late the hour
be.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then wrung Belle&rsquo;s hand, and ascended to
the plain above.</p>
<p>I found the Romany party waiting for me, and everything in
readiness for departing.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno
were mounted on two old horses.&nbsp; The rest, who intended to
go to the fair, amongst whom were two or three women, were on
foot.&nbsp; On arriving at the extremity of the plain, I looked
towards the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel Berners stood at the mouth, the
beams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and
figure.&nbsp; I waved my hand towards her.&nbsp; She slowly
lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I turned away, and never saw
Isopel Berners again.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>My companions and myself proceeded on our way.&nbsp; In
about two hours we reached the place where the fair was to be
held.&nbsp; After breakfasting on bread and cheese and ale behind
a broken stone wall, we drove our animals to the fair.&nbsp; The
fair was a common cattle and horse fair: there was little
merriment going on, but there was no lack of business.&nbsp; By
about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Mr. Petulengro and his
people had disposed of their animals at what they conceived very
fair prices&mdash;they were all in high spirits, and Jasper
proposed to adjourn to a public-house.&nbsp; As we were
proceeding to one, a very fine horse, led by a jockey, made its
appearance on the ground.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro stopped short, and
looked at it steadfastly: &lsquo;Fino covar dove odoy sas miro <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a>&mdash;a fine thing were that, if it
were but mine!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you covet
it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;why do you not purchase
it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We low gyptians never buy animals of that
description; if we did we could never sell them, and most likely
should be had up as horse-stealers.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then why
did you say just now, &ldquo;It were a fine thing if it were but
yours?&rdquo;&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;We gyptians always say
so when we see anything that we admire.&nbsp; An animal like that
is not intended for a little hare like me, but for some grand
gentleman like yourself.&nbsp; I say, brother, do you buy that
horse!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How should I buy the horse, you
foolish person!&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Buy the horse,
brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;if you have not the
money I can lend it you; though I be of lower Egypt.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You talk nonsense,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;however, I wish
you would ask the man the price of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Petulengro, going up to the jockey, inquired the price of the
horse&mdash;the man, looking at him scornfully, made no
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; said I, going up to the
jockey, &lsquo;do me the favour to tell me the price of that
horse, as I suppose it is to sell.&rsquo;&nbsp; The jockey, who
was a surly-looking man, of about fifty, looked at me for a
moment, then, after some hesitation, said, laconically,
&lsquo;Seventy.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said I, and
turned away.&nbsp; &lsquo;Buy that horse,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, coming after me; &lsquo;the dook tells me that in
less than three months he will be sold for twice
seventy.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will have nothing to do with
him,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;besides, Jasper, I don&rsquo;t like
his tail.&nbsp; Did you observe what a mean scrubby tail he
has?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What <!-- page 102--><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>a fool you
are, brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;that very tail
of his shows his breeding.&nbsp; No good bred horse ever yet
carried a fine tail&mdash;&rsquo;tis your scrubby-tailed horses
that are your out-and-outers.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of Syntax,
brother?&nbsp; That tail of his puts me in mind of Syntax.&nbsp;
Well, I say nothing more, have your own way&mdash;all I wonder at
is, that a horse like him was ever brought to such a fair of dog
cattle as this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We then made the best of our way to a public-house, where we
had some refreshment.&nbsp; I then proposed returning to the
encampment, but Mr. Petulengro declined, and remained drinking
with his companions till about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
when various jockeys from the fair came in.&nbsp; After some
conversation a jockey proposed a game of cards; and in a little
time, Mr. Petulengro and another gypsy sat down to play a game of
cards with two of the jockeys.</p>
<p>Though not much acquainted with cards, I soon conceived a
suspicion that the jockeys were cheating Mr. Petulengro and his
companion, I therefore called Mr. Petulengro aside, and gave him
a hint to that effect.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, however, instead of
thanking me, told me to mind my own bread and butter, and
forthwith returned to his game.&nbsp; I continued watching the
players for some hours.&nbsp; The gypsies lost considerably, and
I saw clearly that the jockeys were cheating them most
confoundedly.&nbsp; I therefore once more called Mr. Petulengro
aside, and told him that the jockeys were cheating him, conjuring
him to return to the encampment.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, who was by
this time somewhat the worse for liquor, now fell into a passion,
swore several oaths, and asking me who had made me a Moses over
him and his brethren, told me to return to the encampment by
myself.&nbsp; Incensed at the unworthy return which my well-meant
words received, I forthwith left the house, and having purchased
a few articles of provision, I set out for the dingle
alone.&nbsp; It was dark night when I reached it, and descending
I saw the glimmer of a fire from the depths of the dingle; my
heart beat with fond anticipation of a welcome.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Isopel Berners is waiting for me,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and the first word that I shall hear from her lips is that
she has made up her mind.&nbsp; We shall go to America, and be so
happy together.&rsquo;&nbsp; On reaching the bottom of the
dingle, however, I saw seated near the fire, <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>not Isopel
Berners, but a gypsy girl, who told me that Miss Berners when she
went away had charged her to keep up the fire, and have a kettle
boiling against my arrival.&nbsp; Startled at these words, I
inquired at what hour Isopel had left, and whither she was gone,
and was told that she had left the dingle, with her cart, about
two hours after I departed; but where she was gone she (the girl)
did not know.&nbsp; I then asked whether she had left no message,
and the girl replied that she had left none, but had merely given
directions about the kettle and fire, putting, at the same time,
sixpence into her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very strange,&rsquo; thought
I; then dismissing the gypsy girl I sat down by the fire.&nbsp; I
had no wish for tea, but sat looking on the embers, wondering
what could be the motive of the sudden departure of Isopel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Does she mean to return?&rsquo; thought I to myself.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Surely she means to return,&rsquo; Hope replied, &lsquo;or
she would not have gone away without leaving any
message&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;and yet she could scarcely mean to
return,&rsquo; muttered Foreboding, &lsquo;or she would assuredly
have left some message with the girl.&rsquo;&nbsp; I then thought
to myself what a hard thing it would be, if, after having made up
my mind to assume the yoke of matrimony, I should be disappointed
of the woman of my choice.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, after all,&rsquo;
thought I, &lsquo;I can scarcely be disappointed; if such an ugly
scoundrel as Sylvester had no difficulty in getting such a nice
wife as Ursula, surely I, who am not a tenth part so ugly, cannot
fail to obtain the hand of Isopel Berners, uncommonly fine damsel
though she be.&nbsp; Husbands do not grow upon hedge-rows; she is
merely gone after a little business and will return
to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Comforted in some degree by these hopeful imaginings, I
retired to my tent, and went to sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>GLOOMY FOREBODINGS&mdash;THE POSTMAN&rsquo;S MOTHER&mdash;THE
LETTER&mdash;BEARS AND BARONS&mdash;THE BEST OF ADVICE</p>
<p>Nothing occurred to me of any particular moment during the
following day.&nbsp; Isopel Berners did not return; but Mr.
Petulengro and his companions came home from the fair early in
the morning.&nbsp; <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>When I saw him, which was about
mid-day, I found him with his face bruised and swelled.&nbsp; It
appeared that some time after I had left him, he himself
perceived that the jockeys with whom he was playing cards were
cheating him and his companion, a quarrel ensued, which
terminated in a fight between Mr. Petulengro and one of the
jockeys, which lasted some time, and in which Mr. Petulengro,
though he eventually came off victor, was considerably
beaten.&nbsp; His bruises, in conjunction with his pecuniary
loss, which amounted to about seven pounds, were the cause of his
being much out of humour; before night, however, he had returned
to his usual philosophic frame of mind, and, coming up to me as I
was walking about, apologized for his behaviour on the preceding
day, and assured me that he was determined, from that time
forward, never to quarrel with a friend for giving him good
advice.</p>
<p>Two more days passed, and still Isopel Berners did not
return.&nbsp; Gloomy thoughts and forebodings filled my
mind.&nbsp; During the day I wandered about the neighbouring
roads in the hopes of catching an early glimpse of her and her
returning vehicle; and at night lay awake, tossing about on my
hard couch, listening to the rustle of every leaf, and
occasionally thinking that I heard the sound of her wheels upon
the distant road.&nbsp; Once at midnight, just as I was about to
fall into unconsciousness, I suddenly started up, for I was
convinced that I heard the sound of wheels.&nbsp; I listened most
anxiously, and the sound of wheels striking against stones was
certainly plain enough.&nbsp; &lsquo;She comes at last,&rsquo;
thought I, and for a few moments I felt as if a mountain had been
removed from my breast;&mdash;&lsquo;here she comes at last, now,
how shall I receive her?&nbsp; Oh,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;I
will receive her rather coolly, just as if I was not particularly
anxious about her&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to manage these
women.&rsquo;&nbsp; The next moment the sound became very loud,
rather too loud, I thought, to proceed from her wheels, and then
by degrees became fainter.&nbsp; Rushing out of my tent, I
hurried up the path to the top of the dingle, where I heard the
sound distinctly enough, but it was going from me, and evidently
proceeded from something much larger than the cart of
Isopel.&nbsp; I could, moreover, hear the stamping of a
horse&rsquo;s hoof at a lumbering trot.&nbsp; Those only whose
hopes have been wrought up to a high pitch, and then suddenly
dashed down, can <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>imagine what I felt at that moment;
and yet when I returned to my lonely tent, and lay down on my
hard pallet, the voice of conscience told me that the misery I
was then undergoing, I had fully merited, from the unkind manner
in which I had intended to receive her, when for a brief minute I
supposed that she had returned.</p>
<p>It was on the morning after this affair, and the fourth, if I
forget not, from the time of Isopel&rsquo;s departure, that, as I
was seated on my stone at the bottom of the dingle, getting my
breakfast, I heard an unknown voice from the path
above&mdash;apparently that of a person descending&mdash;exclaim,
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a strange place to bring a letter to;&rsquo;
and presently an old woman, with a belt round her middle, to
which was attached a leathern bag, made her appearance, and stood
before me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if I ever!&rsquo; said she, as she looked about
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;My good gentlewoman,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;pray
what may you please to want?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gentlewoman!&rsquo; said the old dame, &lsquo;please to
want!&mdash;well, I call that speaking civilly, at any
rate.&nbsp; It is true, civil words cost nothing; nevertheless,
we do not always get them.&nbsp; What I please to want is to
deliver a letter to a young man in this place; perhaps you be
he?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the name on the
letter?&rsquo; said I, getting up and going to her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is no name upon it,&rsquo; said she, taking a letter
out of her scrip, and looking at it.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is directed
to the young man in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then it is for me, I make no doubt,&rsquo; said I,
stretching out my hand to take it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Please to pay me
ninepence first,&rsquo; said the old woman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;civility is civility,
and, being rather a scarce article, should meet with some
return.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the letter, young man, and I hope you
will pay for it; for if you do not I must pay the postage
myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You are the postwoman, I
suppose,&rsquo; said I, as I took the letter.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am
the postman&rsquo;s mother,&rsquo; said the old woman; &lsquo;but
as he has a wide beat, I help him as much as I can, and I
generally carry letters to places like this, to which he is
afraid to come himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You say the postage
is ninepence,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
shilling.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I call that
honourable,&rsquo; said the old woman, taking the shilling, and
putting it into her pocket&mdash;&lsquo;here&rsquo;s your change,
young man,&rsquo; said she, offering me threepence.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pray keep that for yourself,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you
deserve it for your trouble.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I call
<!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>that genteel,&rsquo; said the old woman; &lsquo;and as
one good turn deserves another, since you look as if you
couldn&rsquo;t read, I will read your letter for you.&nbsp;
Let&rsquo;s see it; it&rsquo;s from some young woman or other, I
dare say.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;but I can read.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;All the better for
you,&rsquo; said the old woman; &lsquo;your being able to read
will frequently save you a penny, for that&rsquo;s the charge I
generally make for reading letters; though as you behaved so
genteely to me, I should have charged you nothing.&nbsp; Well, if
you can read, why don&rsquo;t you open the letter, instead of
keeping it hanging between your finger and thumb?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am in no hurry to open it,&rsquo; said I, with a
sigh.&nbsp; The old woman looked at me for a
moment&mdash;&lsquo;Well, young man,&rsquo; said she,
&lsquo;there are some&mdash;especially those who can
read&mdash;who don&rsquo;t like to open their letters when
anybody is by, more especially when they come from young
women.&nbsp; Well, I won&rsquo;t intrude upon you, but leave you
alone with your letter.&nbsp; I wish it may contain something
pleasant.&nbsp; God bless you,&rsquo; and with these words she
departed.</p>
<p>I sat down on my stone, with my letter in my hand.&nbsp; I
knew perfectly well that it could have come from no other person
than Isopel Berners; but what did the letter contain?&nbsp; I
guessed tolerably well what its purport was&mdash;an eternal
farewell! yet I was afraid to open the letter, lest my
expectation should be confirmed.&nbsp; There I sat with the
letter, putting off the evil moment as long as possible.&nbsp; At
length I glanced at the direction, which was written in a fine
bold hand, and was directed, as the old woman had said, to the
young man in &lsquo;Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle,&rsquo; with the
addition near ---, in the county of ---.&nbsp; Suddenly the idea
occurred to me, that, after all, the letter might not contain an
eternal farewell, and that Isopel might have written, requesting
me to join her.&nbsp; Could it be so?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Alas!
no,&rsquo; presently said Foreboding.&nbsp; At last I became
ashamed of my weakness.&nbsp; The letter must be opened sooner or
later.&nbsp; Why not at once?&nbsp; So as the bather who, for a
considerable time has stood shivering on the bank, afraid to take
the decisive plunge, suddenly takes it, I tore open the letter
almost before I was aware.&nbsp; I had no sooner done so than a
paper fell out.&nbsp; I examined it; it contained a lock of
bright flaxen hair.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is no good sign,&rsquo;
said I, as I thrust the lock and paper into my bosom, and
proceeded to read the letter, which ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">To the
Young Man in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>I send these lines, with the hope and trust that they will
find you well, even as I am myself at this moment, and in much
better spirits, for my own are not such as I could wish they
were, being sometimes rather hysterical and vapourish, and at
other times, and most often, very low.&nbsp; I am at a sea-port,
and am just going on shipboard; and when you get these I shall be
on the salt waters, on my way to a distant country, and leaving
my own behind me, which I do not expect ever to see again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, young man, I will, in the first place, say
something about the manner in which I quitted you.&nbsp; It must
have seemed somewhat singular to you that I went away without
taking any leave, or giving you the slightest hint that I was
going; but I did not do so without considerable reflection.&nbsp;
I was afraid that I should not be able to support a leave-taking;
and as you had said that you were determined to go wherever I
did, I thought it best not to tell you at all; for I did not
think it advisable that you should go with me, and I wished to
have no dispute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the second place, I wish to say something about an
offer of wedlock which you made me; perhaps, young man, had you
made it at the first period of our acquaintance, I should have
accepted it, but you did not, and kept putting off and putting
off, and behaving in a very strange manner, till I could stand
your conduct no longer, but determined upon leaving you and Old
England, which last step I had been long thinking about; so when
you made your offer at last everything was arranged&mdash;my cart
and donkey engaged to be sold&mdash;and the greater part of my
things disposed of.&nbsp; However, young man, when you did make
it, I frankly tell you that I had half a mind to accept it; at
last, however, after very much consideration, I thought it best
to leave you for ever, because, for some time past, I had become
almost convinced, that though with a wonderful deal of learning,
and exceedingly shrewd in some things, you were&mdash;pray
don&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;at the root mad! and though mad
people, I have been told, sometimes make very good husbands, I
was unwilling that your friends, if you had any, should say that
Belle Berners, the workhouse girl, took advantage of your
infirmity; for there is no concealing that I was born and <!--
page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>bred up in a workhouse; notwithstanding that, my blood
is better than your own, and as good as the best; you having
yourself told me that my name is a noble name, and once, if I
mistake not, that it was the same word as baron, which is the
same thing as bear; and that to be called in old times a bear was
considered as a great compliment&mdash;the bear being a mighty
strong animal, on which account our forefathers called all their
great fighting-men barons, which is the same as bears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, setting matters of blood and family entirely
aside, many thanks to you, young man, from poor Belle, for the
honour you did her in making that same offer; for, after all, it
is an honour to receive an honourable offer, which she could see
clearly yours was, with no floriness nor chaff in it; but, on the
contrary, entire sincerity.&nbsp; She assures you that she shall
always bear it and yourself in mind, whether on land or water;
and as a proof of the good-will she bears to you, she has sent
you a lock of the hair which she wears on her head, which you
were often looking at, and were pleased to call flax, which word
she supposes you meant as a compliment, even as the old people
meant to pass a compliment to their great folks, when they called
them bears; though she cannot help thinking that they might have
found an animal as strong as a bear, and somewhat less uncouth,
to call their great folks after: even as she thinks yourself,
amongst your great store of words, might have found something a
little more genteel to call her hair after than flax, which,
though strong and useful, is rather a coarse and common kind of
article.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And as another proof of the goodwill she bears to you,
she sends you, along with the lock, a piece of advice, which is
worth all the hair in the world, to say nothing of the flax.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Fear God</i>, and take your own part. <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Bible in that,
young man; see how Moses feared God, and how he took his own part
against everybody who meddled with him.&nbsp; And see how David
feared God, and took his own part against all the bloody enemies
which surrounded him&mdash;so fear God, young man, and never give
in!&nbsp; The world can bully, and is fond, provided it sees a
man in a kind of difficulty, of getting about him, calling him
coarse <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>names, and even going so far as to
hustle him; but the world, like all bullies, carries a white
feather in its tail, and no sooner sees a man taking off his
coat, and offering to fight his best, than it scatters here and
there, and is always civil to him afterwards.&nbsp; So when folks
are disposed to ill-treat you, young man, say, &ldquo;Lord have
mercy upon me!&rdquo; and then tip them Long Melford, <a
name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a> to which, as the saying goes, there is
nothing comparable for shortness all the world over; and these
last words, young man, are the last you will ever have from her
who is, nevertheless,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your affectionate female
servant,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Isopel Berners</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading the letter I sat for some time motionless,
holding it in my hand.&nbsp; The day-dream in which I had been a
little time before indulging, of marrying Isopel Berners, of
going with her to America, and having by her a large progeny, who
were to assist me in felling trees, cultivating the soil, and who
would take care of me when I was old, was now thoroughly
dispelled.&nbsp; Isopel had deserted me, and was gone to America
by herself, where, perhaps, she would marry some other person,
and would bear him a progeny, who would do for him what in my
dream I had hoped my progeny by her would do for me.&nbsp; Then
the thought came into my head that though she was gone I might
follow her to America, but then I thought that if I did I might
not find her; America was a very large place, and I did not know
the port to which she was bound; but I could follow her to the
port from which she had sailed, and there possibly discover the
port to which she was bound; but then I did not even know the
port from which she had set out, for Isopel had not dated her
letter from any place.&nbsp; Suddenly it occurred to me that the
post-mark on the letter would tell me from whence it came, so I
forthwith looked at the back of the letter, and in the post-mark
read the name of a well-known and not very distant
sea-port.&nbsp; I then knew with tolerable certainty the port
where she had embarked, and I almost determined to follow her,
but I almost instantly determined to do no such thing.&nbsp;
Isopel Berners had abandoned me, and I would not follow her;
&lsquo;perhaps,&rsquo; whispered pride, &lsquo;if I overtook her,
she would only despise me for running after her;&rsquo; and it
also told me <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>pretty roundly that, provided I ran
after her, whether I overtook her or not, I should heartily
despise myself.&nbsp; So I determined not to follow Isopel
Berners; I took her lock of hair, and looked at it, then put it
in her letter, which I folded up and carefully stowed away,
resolved to keep both for ever, but I determined not to follow
her.&nbsp; Two or three times, however, during the day, I wavered
in my determination, and was again and again almost tempted to
follow her, but every succeeding time the temptation was
fainter.&nbsp; In the evening I left the dingle, and sat down
with Mr. Petulengro and his family by the door of his tent; Mr.
Petulengro soon began talking of the letter which I had received
in the morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is it not from Miss Berners,
brother?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; I told him it was.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
she coming back, brother?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;she is gone to America, and has deserted
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I always knew that you two were never
destined for each other,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;How did you
know that?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;The dook told me so,
brother; you are born to be a great traveller.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I had gone with her to
America, as I was thinking of doing, I should have been a great
traveller.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You are to travel in another
direction, brother,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish you would
tell me all about my future wanderings,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a power of clouds before my
eye.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a poor seer, after all,&rsquo;
said I, and getting up, I retired to my dingle and my tent, where
I betook myself to my bed, and there, knowing the worst, and
being no longer agitated by apprehension, nor agonized by
expectation, I was soon buried in a deep slumber, the first which
I had fallen into for several nights.</p>

IN SEASON&mdash;THE WAY OF THE WORLD&mdash;THE GRATEFUL
MIND&mdash;THE HORSE&rsquo;S NEIGH</p>
<p>It was rather late on the following morning when I
awoke.&nbsp; At first I was almost unconscious of what had
occurred on the preceding day; recollection, however, by degrees
returned, and I felt a deep melancholy coming over me, but
perfectly aware that no advantage could be <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>derived
from the indulgence of such a feeling, I sprang up, prepared my
breakfast, which I ate with a tolerable appetite, and then left
the dingle, and betook myself to the gypsy encampment, where I
entered into discourse with various Romanies, both male and
female.&nbsp; After some time, feeling myself in better spirits,
I determined to pay another visit to the landlord of the
public-house.&nbsp; From the position of his affairs when I had
last visited him, I entertained rather gloomy ideas with respect
to his present circumstances.&nbsp; I imagined that I should
either find him alone in his kitchen smoking a wretched pipe, or
in company with some surly bailiff or his follower, whom his
friend the brewer had sent into the house in order to take
possession of his effects.</p>
<p>Nothing more entirely differing from either of these
anticipations could have presented itself to my view than what I
saw about one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when I entered the
house.&nbsp; I had come, though somewhat in want of consolation
myself, to offer any consolation which was at my command to my
acquaintance Catchpole, and perhaps, like many other people who
go to a house with &lsquo;drops of compassion trembling on their
eyelids,&rsquo; I felt rather disappointed at finding that no
compassion was necessary.&nbsp; The house was thronged with
company, the cries for ale and porter, hot brandy and water, cold
gin and water, were numerous; moreover, no desire to receive and
not to pay for the landlord&rsquo;s liquids was
manifested&mdash;on the contrary, everybody seemed disposed to
play the most honourable part: &lsquo;Landlord, here&rsquo;s the
money for this glass of brandy and water&mdash;do me the favour
to take it; all right, remember I have paid you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Landlord, here&rsquo;s the money for the pint of
half-and-half&mdash;four-pence halfpenny, a&rsquo;nt
it?&mdash;here&rsquo;s sixpence, keep the change&mdash;confound
the change!&rsquo;&nbsp; The landlord, assisted by his niece,
bustled about; his brow erect, his cheeks plumped out, and all
his features exhibiting a kind of surly satisfaction.&nbsp;
Wherever he moved, marks of the most cordial amity were shown
him, hands were thrust out to grasp his, nor were looks of
respect, admiration, nay almost of adoration, wanting.&nbsp; I
observed one fellow, as the landlord advanced, take the pipe out
of his mouth, and gaze upon him with a kind of grin of wonder,
probably much the same as his ancestor, the Saxon lout of old,
put on when he saw his idol Thur dressed in a new <!-- page
112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>kirtle.&nbsp; To avoid the press, I got into a corner,
where, on a couple of chairs, sat two respectable-looking
individuals, whether farmers or sow-gelders, I know not, but
highly respectable-looking, who were discoursing about the
landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such another,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;you
will not find in a summer&rsquo;s day.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,
nor in the whole of England,&rsquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tom of Hopton,&rsquo; said the first; &lsquo;ah! Tom of
Hopton,&rsquo; echoed the other; &lsquo;the man who could beat
Tom of Hopton could beat the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I glory
in him,&rsquo; said the first.&nbsp; &lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said
the second, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll back him against the world.&nbsp;
Let me hear any one say anything against him, and if I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo; then, looking at me, he added,
&lsquo;have you anything to say against him, young
man?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not a word,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;save
that he regularly puts me out.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll
put any one out,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;any one out of
conceit with himself;&rsquo; then, lifting a mug to his mouth, he
added, with a hiccough, &lsquo;I drink his health.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Presently the landlord, as he moved about, observing me, stopped
short: &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are you here?&nbsp; I am
glad to see you, come this way.&nbsp; Stand back,&rsquo; said he
to his company, as I followed him to the bar, &lsquo;stand back
for me and this gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; Two or three young
fellows were in the bar, seemingly sporting yokels, drinking
sherry and smoking.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the
landlord, &lsquo;clear the bar, I must have a clear bar for me
and my friend here.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Landlord, what will you
take?&rsquo; said one&mdash;&lsquo;a glass of sherry?&nbsp; I
know you like it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;--- sherry and you
too,&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;I want neither sherry nor
yourself; didn&rsquo;t you hear what I told you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;All right, old fellow,&rsquo; said the other, shaking the
landlord by the hand&mdash;&lsquo;all right; don&rsquo;t wish to
intrude&mdash;but I suppose when you and your friend have done I
may come in again.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, with &lsquo;A sarvant,
sir,&rsquo; to me, he took himself into the kitchen, followed by
the rest of the sporting yokels.</p>
<p>Thereupon the landlord, taking a bottle of ale from a basket,
uncorked it, and pouring the contents into two large glasses,
handed me one, and motioning me to sit down, placed himself by
me; then, emptying his own glass at a draught, he gave a kind of
grunt of satisfaction, and fixing his eyes upon the opposite side
of the bar, remained motionless, without saying a word, buried
apparently in important cogitations.&nbsp; With respect to
myself, I swallowed my ale more leisurely, and was about to
address my friend, <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>when his niece, coming into the bar,
said that more and more customers were arriving, and how she
should supply their wants she did not know, unless her uncle
would get up and help her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The customers!&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;let the
scoundrels wait till you have time to serve them, or till I have
leisure to see after them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The kitchen
won&rsquo;t contain half of them,&rsquo; said his niece.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then let them sit out abroad,&rsquo; said the
landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;But there are not benches enough,
uncle,&rsquo; said the niece.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then let them stand or
sit on the ground,&rsquo; said the uncle; &lsquo;what care
I?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let them know that the man who beat Tom of
Hopton stands as well again on his legs as ever.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then, opening a side door which led from the bar into the
back-yard, he beckoned me to follow him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You treat
your customers in rather a cavalier manner,&rsquo; said I, when
we were alone together in the yard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;and
I&rsquo;ll treat them more so yet; now I have got the whip-hand
of the rascals I intend to keep it.&nbsp; I dare say you are a
bit surprised with regard to the change which has come over
things since you were last here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you how it
happened.&nbsp; You remember in what a desperate condition you
found me, thinking of changing my religion, selling my soul to
the man in black, and then going and hanging myself like Pontius
Pilate; and I dare say you can&rsquo;t have forgotten how you
gave me good advice, made me drink ale, and give up sherry.&nbsp;
Well, after you were gone, I felt all the better for your talk,
and what you had made me drink, and it was a mercy that I did
feel better, for my niece was gone out, poor thing! and I was
left alone in the house, without a soul to look at, or to keep me
from doing myself a mischief in case I was so inclined.&nbsp;
Well, things wore on in this way till it grew dusk, when in came
that blackguard Hunter with his train to drink at my expense, and
to insult me as usual; there were more than a dozen of them, and
a pretty set they looked.&nbsp; Well, they ordered about in a
very free and easy manner for upwards of an hour and a half,
occasionally sneering and jeering at me, as they had been in the
habit of doing for some time past; so, as I said before, things
wore on, and other customers came in, who, though they did not
belong to Hunter&rsquo;s gang, also passed off their jokes upon
me; for, as you perhaps know, we English are a set of low hounds,
who <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>will always take part with the many
by way of making ourselves safe, and currying favour with the
stronger side.&nbsp; I said little or nothing, for my spirits had
again become very low, and I was verily scared and afraid.&nbsp;
All of a sudden I thought of the ale which I had drank in the
morning, and of the good it did me then, so I went into the bar,
opened another bottle, took a glass, and felt better; so I took
another, and feeling better still, I went back into the kitchen
just as Hunter and his crew were about leaving.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Hunter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you and your people will please to
pay me for what you have had?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
mean by my people?&rdquo; said he, with an oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!
what do you mean by calling us his people?&rdquo; said the
clan.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are nobody&rsquo;s people;&rdquo; and then
there was a pretty load of abuse, and threatening to serve me
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I was perhaps wrong
to call them your people, and beg your pardon and theirs.&nbsp;
And now you will please to pay me for what you have had yourself,
and afterwards I can settle with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
shall pay you when I think fit,&rdquo; said Hunter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the rest, &ldquo;and so shall we.&nbsp;
We shall pay you when we think fit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell
you what,&rdquo; said Hunter, &ldquo;I conceives I do such an old
fool as you an honour when I comes into his house and drinks his
beer, and goes away without paying for it,&rdquo; and then there
was a roar of laughter from everybody, and almost all said the
same thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now do you please to pay me, Mr.
Hunter?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pay you!&rdquo; said
Hunter&mdash;&ldquo;pay you!&nbsp; Yes, here&rsquo;s the
pay,&rdquo; and thereupon he held out his thumb, twirling it
round till it just touched my nose.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you
what I felt that moment; a kind of madhouse thrill came upon me,
and all I know is, that I bent back as far as I could, then
lunging out, struck him under the ear, sending him reeling two or
three yards, when he fell on the floor.&nbsp; I wish you had but
seen how my company looked at me and at each other.&nbsp; One or
two of the clan went to raise Hunter, and get him to fight, but
it was no go; though he was not killed, he had had enough for
that evening.&nbsp; Oh, I wish you had seen my customers; those
who did not belong to the clan, but had taken part with them, and
helped to jeer and flout me, now came and shook me by the hand,
wishing me joy, and saying as how &ldquo;I was a brave fellow,
and had served the bully right!&rdquo;&nbsp; As for the clan,
they all said Hunter was bound to do me justice; so they made
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>him pay me what he owed for himself, and the reckoning
of those among them who said they had no money.&nbsp; Two or
three of them then led him away, while the rest stayed behind,
and flattered me, and worshipped me, and called Hunter all kinds
of dogs&rsquo; names.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it makes good what I read in
a letter which I received yesterday.&nbsp; It is just the way of
the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t it!&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, that ain&rsquo;t all; let me go on.&nbsp; Good
fortune never yet came alone.&nbsp; In about an hour comes home
my poor niece, almost in high sterricks with joy, smiling and
sobbing.&nbsp; She had been to the clergyman of M---, the great
preacher, to whose church she was in the habit of going, and to
whose daughters she was well known; and to him she told a
lamentable tale about my distresses, and about the snares which
had been laid for my soul; and so well did she plead my cause,
and so strong did the young ladies back all she said, that the
good clergyman promised to stand my friend, and to lend me
sufficient money to satisfy the brewer, and to get my soul out of
the snares of the man in black; and sure enough the next morning
the two young ladies brought me the fifty pounds, which I
forthwith carried to the brewer, who was monstrously civil,
saying that he hoped any little misunderstanding we had had would
not prevent our being good friends in future.&nbsp; That
ain&rsquo;t all, the people of the neighbouring country hearing
as if by art witchcraft that I had licked Hunter, and was on good
terms with the brewer, forthwith began to come in crowds to look
at me, pay me homage, and be my customers.&nbsp; Moreover, fifty
scoundrels who owed me money, and who would have seen me starve
rather than help me as long as they considered me a down pin,
remembered their debts, and came and paid me more than they
owed.&nbsp; That ain&rsquo;t all; the brewer, being about to
establish a stage-coach and three, to run across the country,
says it shall stop and change horses at my house, and the
passengers breakfast and sup as it goes and returns.&nbsp; He
wishes me&mdash;whom he calls the best man in England&mdash;to
give his son lessons in boxing, which he says he considers a fine
manly English art, and a great defence against
Popery&mdash;notwithstanding that only a month ago, when he
considered me a down pin, he was in <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>the habit
of railing against it as a blackguard practice, and against me as
a blackguard for following it: so I am going to commence with
young hopeful to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really cannot help congratulating you on your good
fortune,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That ain&rsquo;t all,&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&lsquo;This very morning the folks of our parish made me
churchwarden, <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a> which they would no more have done a
month ago, when they considered me a down pin, than
they&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mercy upon us!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if fortune pours
in upon you in this manner, who knows but that within a year they
may make you justice of the peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who knows, indeed!&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I will prove myself worthy of my good luck by
showing the grateful mind&mdash;not to those who would be kind to
me now, but to those who were, when the days were rather
gloomy.&nbsp; My customers shall have abundance of rough
language, but I&rsquo;ll knock any one down who says anything
against the clergyman who lent me the fifty pounds, or against
the Church of England, of which he is parson and I am
churchwarden.&nbsp; I am also ready to do anything in reason for
him who paid me for the ale he drank, when I shouldn&rsquo;t have
had the heart to collar him for the money had he refused to pay;
who never jeered or flouted me like the rest of my customers when
I was a down pin&mdash;and though he refused to fight cross
<i>for</i> me, was never cross <i>with</i> me, but listened to
all I had to say, and gave me all kinds of good advice.&nbsp; Now
who do you think I mean by this last? why, who but
yourself&mdash;who on earth but yourself?&nbsp; The parson is a
good man and a great preacher, and I&rsquo;ll knock anybody down
who says to the contrary; and I mention him first, because why:
he&rsquo;s a gentleman, and you a tinker.&nbsp; But I am by no
means sure you are not the best friend of the two; for I doubt,
do you see, whether I should have had the fifty pounds but for
you.&nbsp; You persuaded me to give up that silly drink they call
sherry, and drink ale; and what was it but drinking ale which
gave me courage to knock down that fellow Hunter&mdash;and
knocking him down was, I verily believe, the turning point of my
disorder.&nbsp; God don&rsquo;t love those who won&rsquo;t strike
out for themselves; and as far as I can calculate with respect to
time, it was just the moment after I had knocked down Hunter,
that the parson <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>consented to lend me the money, and
everything began to grow civil to me.&nbsp; So, dash my buttons
if I show the ungrateful mind to you!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t offer
to knock anybody down for you, because why&mdash;I daresay you
can knock a body down yourself; but I&rsquo;ll offer something
more to the purpose; as my business is wonderfully on the
increase, I shall want somebody to help me in serving my
customers, and keeping them in order.&nbsp; If you choose to come
and serve for your board, and what they&rsquo;ll give you, give
me your fist; or if you like ten shillings a week better than
their sixpences and ha&rsquo;pence, only say so&mdash;though, to
be open with you, I believe you would make twice ten shillings
out of them&mdash;the sneaking, fawning, curry-favouring
humbugs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am much obliged to you,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for
your handsome offer, which, however, I am obliged to
decline.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; said the landlord.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not fit for service,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;moreover, I am about to leave this part of the
country.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I spoke, a horse neighed in the
stable.&nbsp; &lsquo;What horse is that?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It belongs to a cousin of mine, who put it into my
hands yesterday, in hopes that I might get rid of it for him,
though he would no more have done so a week ago, when he
considered me a down pin, than he would have given the horse
away.&nbsp; Are you fond of horses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very much,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then come and look at it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He led me into
the stable, where, in a stall, stood a noble-looking animal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I saw this horse at ---
fair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like enough,&rsquo; said the landlord; &lsquo;he was
there, and was offered for seventy pounds, but didn&rsquo;t find
a bidder at any price.&nbsp; What do you think of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a splendid creature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am no judge of horses,&rsquo; said the landlord;
&lsquo;but I am told he&rsquo;s a first-rate trotter, good
leaper, and has some of the blood of Syntax.&nbsp; What does all
that signify?&mdash;the game is against his master, who is a down
pin, is thinking of emigrating, and wants money
confoundedly.&nbsp; He asked seventy pounds at the fair; but,
between ourselves, he would be glad to take fifty
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I almost wish,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that I were a rich
squire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would buy him then,&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
Here he mused for some time, with a very profound look.&nbsp;
<!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&lsquo;It would be a rum thing,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;if, some time or other that horse should come into your
hands.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you hear how he neighed when you talked
about leaving the country.&nbsp; My granny was a wise woman, and
was up to all kind of signs and wonders, sounds and noises, the
interpretation of the language of birds and animals, crowing and
lowing, neighing and braying.&nbsp; If she had been here, she
would have said at once that that horse was fated to carry you
away.&nbsp; On that point, however, I can say nothing, for under
fifty pounds no one can have him.&nbsp; Are you taking that money
out of your pocket to pay me for the ale?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t
do; nothing to pay; I invited you this time.&nbsp; Now, if you
are going, you had best get into the road through the
yard-gate.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t trouble you to make your way
through the kitchen and my fine-weather company&mdash;confound
them!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>MR. PETULENGRO&rsquo;S DEVICE&mdash;THE LEATHERN
PURSE&mdash;CONSENT TO PURCHASE A HORSE</p>
<p>As I returned along the road I met Mr. Petulengro and one of
his companions, who told me that they were bound for the
public-house; whereupon I informed Jasper how I had seen in the
stable the horse which we had admired at the fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you buy that horse after all,
brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; With a smile at the
absurdity of such a supposition, I left him and his companion,
and betook myself to the dingle.&nbsp; In the evening I received
a visit from Mr. Petulengro, who forthwith commenced talking
about the horse, which he had again seen, the landlord having
shown it to him on learning that he was a friend of mine.&nbsp;
He told me that the horse pleased him more than ever, he having
examined his points with more accuracy than he had an opportunity
of doing on the first occasion, concluding by pressing me to buy
him.&nbsp; I begged him to desist from such foolish importunity,
assuring him that I had never so much money in all my life as
would enable me to purchase the horse.&nbsp; Whilst this
discourse was going on, Mr. Petulengro and myself were standing
together in the midst of the dingle.&nbsp; <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>Suddenly he
began to move round me in a very singular manner, making strange
motions with his hands, and frightful contortions with his
features, till I became alarmed, and asked him whether he had not
lost his senses?&nbsp; Whereupon, ceasing his movements and
contortions, he assured me that he had not, but had merely been
seized with a slight dizziness, and then once more returned to
the subject of the horse.&nbsp; Feeling myself very angry, I told
him that if he continued persecuting me in this manner, I should
be obliged to quarrel with him; adding, that I believed his only
motive for asking me to buy the animal was to insult my
poverty.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty poverty,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;with
fifty pounds in your pocket; however, I have heard say, that it
is always the custom of your rich people to talk of their
poverty, more especially when they wish to avoid laying out
money.&rsquo;&nbsp; Surprised at his saying that I had fifty
pounds in my pocket, I asked him what he meant; whereupon he told
me that he was very sure that I had fifty pounds in my pocket,
offering to lay me five shillings to that effect.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Done,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I have scarcely more than the
fifth part of what you say.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know better,
brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;and if you only pull
out what you have in the pocket of your slop, I am sure you will
have lost your wager.&rsquo;&nbsp; Putting my hand into the
pocket, I felt something which I had never felt there before, and
pulling it out, perceived that it was a clumsy leathern purse,
which I found, on opening, contained four ten-pound notes, and
several pieces of gold.&nbsp; &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so,
brother?&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, in the
first place, please to pay me the five shillings you have
lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;This is only a foolish piece of
pleasantry,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you put it into my pocket
whilst you were moving about me, making faces like a distracted
person.&nbsp; Here, take your purse back.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I?&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;not I, indeed!
don&rsquo;t think I am such a fool.&nbsp; I have won my wager, so
pay me the five shillings, brother.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do drop
this folly,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and take your purse;&rsquo; and
I flung it on the ground.&nbsp; &lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, &lsquo;you were talking of quarrelling with me just
now.&nbsp; I tell you now one thing, which is, that if you do not
take back the purse, I will quarrel with you; and it shall be for
good and all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll drop your acquaintance, no longer
call you my pal, and not even say sarshan <a
name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a> to <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>you when I
meet you by the roadside.&nbsp; Hir mi diblis <a
name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a> I never will.&rsquo;&nbsp; I saw by
Jasper&rsquo;s look and tone that he was in earnest, and, as I
had really a regard for the strange being, I scarcely knew what
to do.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, be persuaded, brother,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, taking up the purse, and handing it to me; &lsquo;be
persuaded; put the purse into your pocket, and buy the
horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I did
so, would you acknowledge the horse to be yours, and receive the
money again as soon as I should be able to repay you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would, brother, I would,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;return me the money as soon as you please, provided you
buy the horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What motive have you for
wishing me to buy that horse?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s to be sold for fifty pounds,&rsquo; said
Jasper, &lsquo;and is worth four times that sum; though, like
many a splendid bargain, he is now going a begging; buy him, and
I&rsquo;m confident that, in a little time, a grand gentleman of
your appearance may have anything he asks for him, and found a
fortune by his means.&nbsp; Moreover, brother, I want to dispose
of this fifty pounds in a safe manner.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
take it, I shall fool it away in no time, perhaps at
card-playing, for you saw how I was cheated by those blackguard
jockeys the other day&mdash;we gyptians don&rsquo;t know how to
take care of money: our best plan when we have got a handful of
guineas is to make buttons with them; but I have plenty of golden
buttons, and don&rsquo;t wish to be troubled with more, so you
can do me no greater favour than vesting the money in this
speculation, by which my mind will be relieved of considerable
care and trouble for some time at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving that I still hesitated, he said, &lsquo;Perhaps,
brother, you think that I did not come honestly by the money: by
the honestest manner in the world, brother, for it is the money I
earnt by fighting in the ring: I did not steal it, brother, nor
did I get it by disposing of spavined donkeys, or glandered
ponies&mdash;nor is it, brother, the profits of my wife&rsquo;s
witchcraft and dukkerin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you had better employ it in
your traffic.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have plenty of money for my
traffic, independent of this capital,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&lsquo;ay, brother, and enough besides to back the husband of my
wife&rsquo;s sister, Sylvester, against Slammocks of the Chong
gav for twenty pounds, which I am thinking of doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;after all, the horse
may have found another purchaser by this time.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Not he,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;there is nobody
in this neighbourhood to purchase a horse like that, unless it be
your lordship&mdash;so take the money, brother,&rsquo; and he
thrust the purse into my hand.&nbsp; Allowing myself to be
persuaded, I kept possession of the purse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you
satisfied now?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;By no means,
brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &lsquo;you will please to
pay me the five shillings which you lost to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the fifty pounds which I found
in my pocket were not mine, but put in by yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with the matter,
brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;I betted you five
shillings that you had fifty pounds in your pocket, which sum you
had: I did not say that they were your own, but merely that you
had fifty pounds; you will therefore pay me, brother, or I shall
not consider you an honourable man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to
have any dispute about such a matter, I took five shillings out
of my under pocket, and gave them to him.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro
took the money with great glee, observing&mdash;&lsquo;These five
shillings I will take to the public-house forthwith, and spend in
drinking with four of my brethren, and doing so will give me an
opportunity of telling the landlord that I have found a customer
for his horse, and that you are the man.&nbsp; It will be as well
to secure the horse as soon as possible; for though the dook
tells me that the horse is intended for you, I have now and then
found that the dook is, like myself, somewhat given to
lying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then departed, and I remained alone in the dingle.&nbsp; I
thought at first that I had committed a great piece of folly in
consenting to purchase this horse; I might find no desirable
purchaser for him until the money in my possession should be
totally exhausted, and then I might be compelled to sell him for
half the price I had given for him, or be even glad to find a
person who would receive him at a gift; I should then remain sans
horse, and indebted to Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
possible that I might sell the horse very advantageously, and by
so doing, obtain a fund sufficient to enable me to execute some
grand enterprise or other.&nbsp; My present way of life afforded
no prospect of support, whereas the purchase of the horse did
afford a possibility of bettering my condition, so, after all,
had I not done right in consenting to purchase the horse? the
purchase was to be made with <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>another
person&rsquo;s property it is true, and I did not exactly like
the idea of speculating with another person&rsquo;s property, but
Mr. Petulengro had thrust his money upon me, and if I lost his
money, he could have no one but himself to blame; so I persuaded
myself that I had upon the whole done right, and having come to
that persuasion I soon began to enjoy the idea of finding myself
on horseback again, and figured to myself all kinds of strange
adventures which I should meet with on the roads before the horse
and I should part company.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>TRYING THE HORSE&mdash;THE FEATS OF TAWNO&mdash;MAN WITH THE
RED WAISTCOAT&mdash;DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY</p>
<p>I saw nothing more of Mr. Petulengro that evening; on the
morrow, however, he came and informed me that he had secured the
horse for me, and that I was to go and pay for it at noon.&nbsp;
At the hour appointed, therefore, I went with Mr. Petulengro and
Tawno to the public, where, as before, there was a crowd of
company.&nbsp; The landlord received us in the bar with marks of
much satisfaction and esteem, made us sit down, and treated us
with some excellent mild draught ale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who do you
think has been here this morning?&rsquo; he said to me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why that fellow in black, who came to carry me off to a
house of Popish devotion, where I was to pass seven days and
nights in meditation, as I think he called it, before I publicly
renounced the religion of my country.&nbsp; I read him a pretty
lecture, calling him several unhandsome names, and asking him
what he meant by attempting to seduce a churchwarden of the
Church of England.&nbsp; I tell you what, he ran some danger, for
some of my customers, learning his errand, laid hold on him, and
were about to toss him in a blanket, and then duck him in the
horse-pond.&nbsp; I, however, interfered, and said that what he
came about was between me and him, and that it was no business of
theirs.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I felt pity for the poor
devil, more especially when I considered that they merely sided
against him because they thought him the weakest, and that they
would have wanted to serve me in the same manner had they
considered me a down <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>pin; so I rescued him from their
hands, told him not to be afraid, for that nobody should touch
him, and offered to treat him to some cold gin and water with a
lump of sugar in it; and, on his refusing, told him that he had
better make himself scarce, which he did, and I hope I shall
never see him again.&nbsp; So I suppose you are come for the
horse; mercy upon us!&mdash;who would have thought you would have
become the purchaser?&nbsp; The horse, however, seemed to know it
by its neighing.&nbsp; How did you ever come by the money?&nbsp;
However, that&rsquo;s no matter of mine.&nbsp; I suppose you are
strongly backed by certain friends you have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I informed the landlord that he was right in supposing that I
came for the horse, but that, before I paid for him, I should
wish to prove his capabilities.&nbsp; &lsquo;With all my
heart,&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall mount him
this moment.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, going into the stable, he saddled
and bridled the horse, and presently brought him out before the
door.&nbsp; I mounted him, Mr. Petulengro putting a heavy whip
into my hand, and saying a few words to me in his own mysterious
language.&nbsp; &lsquo;The horse wants no whip,&rsquo; said the
landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold your tongue, daddy,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;My pal knows quite well what to do with
the whip; he&rsquo;s not going to beat the horse with
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; About four hundred yards from the house there
was a hill, to the foot of which the road ran almost on a perfect
level; towards the foot of this hill I trotted the horse, who set
off at a long, swift pace, seemingly at the rate of about sixteen
miles an hour.&nbsp; On reaching the foot of the hill, I wheeled
the animal round, and trotted him towards the house&mdash;the
horse sped faster than before.&nbsp; Ere he had advanced a
hundred yards, I took off my hat, in obedience to the advice
which Mr. Petulengro had given me, in his own language, and
holding it over the horse&rsquo;s head, commenced drumming on the
crown with the knob of the whip; the horse gave a slight start,
but instantly recovering himself, continued his trot till he
arrived at the door of the public-house, amidst the acclamations
of the company, who had all rushed out of the house to be
spectators of what was going on.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see now what you
wanted the whip for,&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;and sure
enough that drumming on your hat was no bad way of learning
whether the horse was quiet or not.&nbsp; Well, did you ever see
a more quiet horse, or a better trotter?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My
cob shall <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>trot against him,&rsquo; said a
fellow dressed in velveteen, mounted on a low powerful-looking
animal&mdash;&lsquo;my cob shall trot against him to the hill and
back again&mdash;come on!&rsquo;&nbsp; We both started; the cob
kept up gallantly against the horse for about half the way to the
hill, when he began to lose ground; at the foot of the hill he
was about fifteen yards behind.&nbsp; Whereupon I turned slowly
and waited for him.&nbsp; We then set off towards the house, but
now the cob had no chance, being at least twenty yards behind
when I reached the door.&nbsp; This running of horses, the wild
uncouth forms around me, and the ale and beer which were being
guzzled from pots and flagons, put me wonderfully in mind of the
ancient horse-races of the heathen north.&nbsp; I almost imagined
myself Gunnar of Hlitharend at the race of&mdash;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you satisfied?&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that he could leap?&rsquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am told he can,&rsquo; said the
landlord; &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t consent that he should be
tried in that way, as he might be damaged.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t trust my pal to leap that horse; he&rsquo;ll
merely fling him down and break his neck and his own.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a better man than he close by; let him get on his
back and leap him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You mean yourself, I
suppose,&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, I call that
talking modestly, and nothing becomes a young man more than
modesty.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t I, daddy,&rsquo; said
Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the man,&rsquo; said
he, pointing to Tawno.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the horse-leaper
of the world!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You mean the
horse-back-breaker,&rsquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;That
big fellow would break down my cousin&rsquo;s horse.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why he weighs only sixteen stone,&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro; &lsquo;and his sixteen stone, with his way of
handling a horse, does not press so much as any other one&rsquo;s
thirteen.&nbsp; Only let him get on the horse&rsquo;s back and
you&rsquo;ll see what he can do!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said the landlord, &lsquo;it won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon Mr. Petulengro became very much excited, and, pulling
out a handful of money, said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
I&rsquo;ll forfeit these guineas if my black pal there does the
horse any kind of damage; duck me in the horse-pond if I
don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the landlord,
&lsquo;for the sport of the thing I consent, so let your white
pal get down, and your black pal mount as soon as he
pleases.&rsquo;&nbsp; I felt rather mortified at Mr.
Petulengro&rsquo;s interference, and showed no disposition to
quit my seat; whereupon he came up <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>to me and
said, &lsquo;Now, brother, do get out of the saddle; you are no
bad hand at trotting, I am willing to acknowledge that; but at
leaping a horse there is no one like Tawno.&nbsp; Let every dog
be praised for his own gift.&nbsp; You have been showing off in
your line for the last half-hour, now do give Tawno a chance of
exhibiting a little; poor fellow, he hasn&rsquo;t often a chance
of exhibiting, as his wife keeps him so much in
sight.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to appear desirous of engrossing
the public attention, and feeling rather desirous to see how
Tawno, of whose exploits in leaping horses I had frequently
heard, would acquit himself in the affair, I at length
dismounted, and Tawno at a bound leaped into the saddle, where he
really looked like Gunnar of Hlitharend, save and except that the
complexion of Gunnar was florid, whereas that of Tawno was of
nearly Mulatto darkness, and that all Tawno&rsquo;s features were
cast in the Grecian model, whereas Gunnar had a snub nose.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a leaping-bar behind the house,&rsquo; said
the landlord.&nbsp; &lsquo;Leaping-bar!&rsquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, scornfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think my black pal
ever rides at a leaping-bar?&nbsp; No more than at a
windle-straw.&nbsp; Leap over that meadow wall,
Tawno.&rsquo;&nbsp; Just pass the house, in the direction in
which I had been trotting, was a wall about four feet high,
beyond which was a small meadow.&nbsp; Tawno rode the horse
gently up to the wall, permitted him to look over, then backed
him for about ten yards, and pressing his calves against the
horse&rsquo;s sides, he loosed the rein, and the horse launching
forward, took the leap in gallant style.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well done,
man and horse!&rsquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &lsquo;now come back,
Tawno.&rsquo;&nbsp; The leap from the side of the meadow was,
however, somewhat higher; and the horse, when pushed at it, at
first turned away; whereupon Tawno backed him to a greater
distance, pushed the horse to a full gallop, giving a wild cry;
whereupon the horse again took the wall, slightly grazing one of
his legs against it.&nbsp; &lsquo;A near thing,&rsquo; said the
landlord, &lsquo;but a good leap.&nbsp; Now, no more leaping, so
long as I have control over the animal.&rsquo;&nbsp; The horse
was then led back to the stable; and the landlord, myself, and
companions going into the bar, I paid down the money for the
horse.</p>
<p>Scarcely was the bargain concluded, when two or three of the
company began to envy me the possession of the horse, and forcing
their way into the bar, with much noise <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and
clamour, said that the horse had been sold too cheap.&nbsp; One
fellow in particular, with a red waistcoat, the son of a wealthy
farmer, said that if he had but known that the horse had been so
good a one, he would have bought it at the first price asked for
it, which he was now willing to pay, that is, to-morrow,
supposing&mdash;&lsquo;Supposing your father will let you have
the money,&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;which, after all,
might not be the case; but, however that may be, it is too late
now.&nbsp; I think myself the horse has been sold for too little
money, but if so all the better for the young man, who came
forward when no other body did with his money in his hand.&nbsp;
There, take yourselves out of my bar,&rsquo; said he to the
fellows; &lsquo;and a pretty scoundrel you,&rsquo; said he to the
man of the red waistcoat, &lsquo;to say the horse has been sold
too cheap, why, it was only yesterday you said he was good for
nothing, and were passing all kinds of jokes at him.&nbsp; Take
yourself out of my bar, I say, you and all of you,&rsquo; and he
turned the fellows out.&nbsp; I then asked the landlord whether
he would permit the horse to remain in the stable for a short
time, provided I paid for his entertainment, and on his willingly
consenting, I treated my friends with ale, and then returned with
them to the encampment.</p>
<p>That evening I informed Mr. Petulengro and his party that on
the morrow I intended to mount my horse, and leave that part of
the country in quest of adventures; inquiring of Jasper where, in
the event of my selling the horse advantageously, I might meet
with him, and repay the money I had borrowed of him; whereupon
Mr. Petulengro informed me that in about ten weeks I might find
him at a certain place at the Chong gav.&nbsp; I then stated that
as I could not well carry with me the property which I possessed
in the dingle, which after all was of no considerable value, I
resolved to bestow the said property, namely, the pony, tent,
tinker-tools, etc., on Ursula and her husband, partly because
they were poor, and partly on account of the great kindness which
I bore to Ursula, from whom I had, on various occasions,
experienced all manner of civility, particularly in regard to
crabbed words.&nbsp; On hearing this intelligence, Ursula
returned many thanks to her gentle brother as she called me, and
Sylvester was so overjoyed that, casting aside his usual phlegm,
he said I was the best friend he had ever had in the world, and
in testimony of his gratitude <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>swore that
he would permit me to give his wife a choomer in the presence of
the whole company, which offer, however, met with a very
mortifying reception; the company frowning disapprobation, Ursula
protesting against anything of the kind, and I myself showing no
forwardness to avail myself of it, having inherited from nature a
considerable fund of modesty, to which was added no slight store
acquired in the course of my Irish education.&nbsp; I passed that
night alone in the dingle in a very melancholy manner, with
little or no sleep, thinking of Isopel Berners; and in the
morning when I quitted it I shed several tears, as I reflected
that I should probably never again see the spot where I had
passed so many hours in her company.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>FAREWELL TO THE ROMANS&mdash;THE LANDLORD AND HIS
NIECE&mdash;SET OUT AS A TRAVELLER</p>
<p>On reaching the plain above, I found my Romany friends
breakfasting, and on being asked by Mr. Petulengro to join them,
I accepted the invitation.&nbsp; No sooner was breakfast over
than I informed Ursula and her husband that they would find the
property, which I had promised them, below in the dingle,
commending the little pony Ambrol to their best care.&nbsp; I
took leave of the whole company, which was itself about to break
up camp and to depart in the direction of London, and made the
best of my way to the public-house.&nbsp; I had a small bundle in
my hand, and was dressed in the same manner as when I departed
from London, having left my waggoner&rsquo;s slop with the other
effects in the dingle.&nbsp; On arriving at the public-house, I
informed the landlord that I was come for my horse, inquiring, at
the same time, whether he could not accommodate me with a bridle
and saddle.&nbsp; He told me that the bridle and saddle, with
which I had ridden the horse on the preceding day, were at my
service for a trifle; that he had received them some time since
in payment for a debt, and that he had himself no use for
them.&nbsp; The leathers of the bridle were rather shabby, and
the bit rusty, and the saddle was old-fashioned; but I was happy
to purchase them for seven shillings, more <!-- page 128--><a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>especially
as the landlord added a small valise, which he said could be
strapped to the saddle, and which I should find very convenient
for carrying my things in.&nbsp; I then proceeded to the stable,
told the horse we were bound on an expedition, and giving him a
feed of corn, left him to discuss it, and returned to the
bar-room to have a little farewell chat with the landlord and at
the same time to drink with him a farewell glass of ale.&nbsp;
Whilst we were talking and drinking, the niece came and joined
us: she was a decent, sensible, young woman, who appeared to take
a great interest in her uncle, whom she regarded with a singular
mixture of pride and disapprobation&mdash;pride for the renown
which he had acquired by his feats of old, and disapprobation for
his late imprudences.&nbsp; She said that she hoped that his
misfortunes would be a warning to him to turn more to his God
than he had hitherto done, and to give up cock-fighting and other
low-life practices.&nbsp; To which the landlord replied, that
with respect to cock-fighting he intended to give it up entirely,
being determined no longer to risk his capital upon birds, and
with respect to his religious duties he should attend the church
of which he was churchwarden at least once a quarter, adding,
however, that he did not intend to become either canter or
driveller, neither of which characters would befit a publican
surrounded by such customers as he was, and that to the last day
of his life he hoped to be able to make use of his fists.&nbsp;
After a stay of about two hours I settled accounts; and having
bridled and saddled my horse, and strapped on the valise, I
mounted, shook hands with the landlord and his niece, and
departed, notwithstanding that they both entreated me to tarry
until the evening, it being then the heat of the day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>AN ADVENTURE ON THE ROADS&mdash;THE SIX FLINT STONES&mdash;A
RURAL SCENE&mdash;MEAD&mdash;THE OLD MAN AND HIS BEES</p>
<p>I bent my course in the direction of the north, more induced
by chance than any particular motive; all quarters of the world
having about equal attractions for me.&nbsp; I was in high
spirits at finding myself once more on horseback, and trotted
gaily on, until the heat of the weather induced me to slacken my
pace, more out of pity <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>for my
horse than because I felt any particular inconvenience from
it&mdash;heat and cold being then, and still, matters of great
indifference to me.&nbsp; What I thought of I scarcely know, save
and except that I have a glimmering recollection that I felt some
desire to meet with one of those adventures, which upon the roads
of England are generally as plentiful as blackberries in autumn;
and Fortune, who has generally been ready to gratify my
inclinations, provided it cost her very little by so doing, was
not slow in furnishing me with an adventure, perhaps as
characteristic of the English roads as anything which could have
happened.</p>
<p>I might have travelled about six miles, amongst cross-roads
and lanes, when suddenly I found myself upon a broad and very
dusty road, which seemed to lead due north.&nbsp; As I wended
along this, I saw a man upon a donkey, riding towards me.&nbsp;
The man was commonly dressed, with a broad felt hat on his head,
and a kind of satchel on his back; he seemed to be in a mighty
hurry, and was every now and then belabouring the donkey with a
cudgel.&nbsp; The donkey, however, which was a fine large
creature of the silver-grey species, did not appear to sympathize
at all with its rider in his desire to get on, but kept its head
turned back as much as possible, moving from one side of the road
to the other, and not making much forward way.&nbsp; As I passed,
being naturally of a very polite disposition, I gave the man the
sele of the day, asking him, at the same time, why he beat the
donkey; whereupon the fellow, eyeing me askance, told me to mind
my own business, with the addition of something which I need not
repeat.&nbsp; I had not proceeded a furlong before I saw seated
on the dust by the wayside, close by a heap of stones, and with
several flints before him, a respectable-looking old man, with a
straw hat and a white smock, who was weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you crying for, father?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you come to any hurt?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Hurt
enough,&rsquo; sobbed the old man, &lsquo;I have been just
tricked out of the best ass in England by a villain, who gave me
nothing but these trash in return,&rsquo; pointing to the stones
before him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I really scarcely understand you,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;I wish you would explain yourself more
clearly.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I was riding on my ass from
market,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;when I met here a fellow
with a sack on his back, who, after staring at the ass and <!--
page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>me a moment or two, asked me if I would sell her.&nbsp;
I told him that I could not think of selling her, as she was very
useful to me, and though an animal, my true companion, whom I
loved as much as if she were my wife and daughter.&nbsp; I then
attempted to pass on, but the fellow stood before me, begging me
to sell her; saying that he would give me anything for her, well,
seeing that he persisted, I said at last that if I sold her, I
must have six pounds for her, and I said so to get rid of him,
for I saw that he was a shabby fellow, who had probably not six
shillings in the world; but I had better have held my
tongue,&rsquo; said the old man, crying more bitterly than
before, &lsquo;for the words were scarcely out of my mouth, when
he said he would give me what I asked, and taking the sack from
his back, he pulled out a steelyard, and going to the heap of
stones there, he took up several of them and weighed them, then
flinging them down before me, he said, &ldquo;There are six
pounds, neighbour; now, get off the ass, and hand her over to
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I sat like one dumbfoundered for a time,
till at last I asked him what he meant?&nbsp; &ldquo;What do I
mean,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you old rascal, why I mean to claim
my purchase,&rdquo; and then he swore so awfully, that scarcely
knowing what I did I got down, and he jumped on the animal and
rode off as fast as he could.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose he
was the fellow,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;whom I just now met upon a
fine grey ass, which he was beating with a cudgel.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I dare say he was,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;I saw
him beating her as he rode away, and I thought I should have
died.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I never heard such a story,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;well, do you mean to submit to such a piece of roguery
quietly?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, dear,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;what can I do?&nbsp; I am seventy-nine years of age; I am
bad on my feet, and daren&rsquo;t go after him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Shall I go?&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;the fellow is a thief,
and any one has a right to stop him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, if
you could but bring her again to me,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;I would bless you to my dying day; but have a care; I
don&rsquo;t know but after all the law may say that she is his
lawful purchase.&nbsp; I asked six pounds for her, and he gave me
six pounds.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Six flints you mean,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;no, no, the law is not quite so bad as that either; I
know something about her, and am sure that she will never
sanction such a quibble.&nbsp; At all events, I&rsquo;ll ride
after the fellow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon turning the horse round,
I put him to his very best trot; I rode nearly a mile without
obtaining a glimpse <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>of the fellow, and was becoming
apprehensive that he had escaped me by turning down some by-path,
two or three of which I had passed.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, on
the road making a slight turning, I perceived him right before
me, moving at a tolerably swift pace, having by this time
probably overcome the resistance of the animal.&nbsp; Putting my
horse to a full gallop, I shouted at the top of my voice,
&lsquo;Get off that donkey, you rascal, and give her up to me, or
I&rsquo;ll ride you down.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fellow hearing the
thunder of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs behind him, drew up on one
side of the road.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; said he,
as I stopped my charger, now almost covered with sweat and foam,
close beside him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you want to rob
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;To rob you?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No! but to take from you that ass, of which you have just
robbed its owner.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have robbed no
man,&rsquo; said the fellow; &lsquo;I just now purchased it
fairly of its master, and the law will give it to me; he asked
six pounds for it, and I gave him six pounds.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Six stones, you mean, you rascal,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;get down, or my horse shall be upon you in a
moment;&rsquo; then with a motion of my reins, I caused the horse
to rear, pressing his sides with my heels as if I intended to
make him leap.&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; said the man,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get down, and then try if I can&rsquo;t serve
you out.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then got down, and confronted me with
his cudgel; he was a horrible-looking fellow, and seemed prepared
for anything.&nbsp; Scarcely, however, had he dismounted, when
the donkey jerked the bridle out of his hand, and probably in
revenge for the usage she had received, gave him a pair of
tremendous kicks on the hip with her hinder legs, which
overturned him, and then scampered down the road the way she had
come.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pretty treatment this,&rsquo; said the fellow,
getting up without his cudgel, and holding his hand to his side,
&lsquo;I wish I may not be lamed for life.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And if you be,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it would merely serve
you right, you rascal, for trying to cheat a poor old man out of
his property by quibbling at words.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Rascal!&rsquo; said the fellow, &lsquo;you lie, I am no
rascal; and as for quibbling with words&mdash;suppose I
did!&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; All the first people does it!&nbsp;
The newspapers does it!&nbsp; The gentlefolks that calls
themselves the guides of the popular mind does it!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m no ignoramus.&nbsp; I reads the newspapers, and knows
what&rsquo;s what.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You read them to some
purpose,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, if you are lamed for

132</span>newspaper editor; I should say you are perfectly
qualified, and this day&rsquo;s adventure may be the foundation
of your fortune,&rsquo; thereupon I turned round and rode
off.&nbsp; The fellow followed me with a torrent of abuse.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Confound you!&rsquo; said he&mdash;yet that was not the
expression either&mdash;&lsquo;I know you; you are one of the
horse-patrol, come down into the country on leave to see your
relations.&nbsp; Confound you, you and the like of you have
knocked my business on the head near Lunnon, and I suppose we
shall have you shortly in the country.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;To the
newspaper office,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and fabricate falsehoods
out of flint stones;&rsquo; then touching the horse with my
heels, I trotted off, and coming to the place where I had seen
the old man, I found him there, risen from the ground, and
embracing his ass.</p>
<p>I told him that I was travelling down the road, and said, that
if his way lay in the same direction as mine, he could do no
better than accompany me for some distance, lest the fellow, who,
for aught I knew, might be hovering nigh, might catch him alone,
and again get his ass from him.&nbsp; After thanking me for my
offer, which he said he would accept, he got upon his ass, and we
proceeded together down the road.&nbsp; My new acquaintance said
very little of his own accord; and when I asked him a question,
answered rather incoherently.&nbsp; I heard him every now and
then say, &lsquo;Villain!&rsquo; to himself, after which he would
pat the donkey&rsquo;s neck, from which circumstance I concluded
that his mind was occupied with his late adventure.&nbsp; After
travelling about two miles, we reached a place where a drift-way
on the right led from the great road; here my companion stopped,
and on my asking him whether he was going any farther, he told me
that the path to the right was the way to his home.</p>
<p>I was bidding him farewell, when he hemmed once or twice, and
said, that as he did not live far off, he hoped that I would go
with him and taste some of his mead.&nbsp; As I had never tasted
mead, of which I had frequently read in the compositions of the
Welsh bards, and, moreover, felt rather thirsty from the heat of
the day, I told him that I should have great pleasure in
attending him.&nbsp; Whereupon, turning off together, we
proceeded about half a mile, sometimes between stone walls, and
at other times hedges, till we reached a small hamlet, through
which we passed, and presently came to a very pretty cottage,
delightfully situated within a garden, surrounded by a <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>hedge of woodbines.&nbsp; Opening a gate at one corner
of the garden, he led the way to a large shed, which stood partly
behind the cottage, which he said was his stable; thereupon he
dismounted and led his donkey into the shed, which was without
stalls, but had a long rack and manger.&nbsp; On one side he tied
his donkey, after taking off her caparisons, and I followed his
example, tying my horse at the other side with a rope halter
which he gave me; he then asked me to come in and taste his mead,
but I told him that I must attend to the comfort of my horse
first, and forthwith, taking a whisp of straw, rubbed him
carefully down.&nbsp; Then taking a pailful of clear water which
stood in the shed, I allowed the horse to drink about half a
pint; and then turning to the old man, who all the time had stood
by looking at my proceedings, I asked him whether he had any
oats?&nbsp; &lsquo;I have all kinds of grain,&rsquo; he replied;
and, going out, he presently returned with two measures, one a
large and the other a small one, both filled with oats, mixed
with a few beans, and handing the large one to me for the horse,
he emptied the other before the donkey, who, before she began to
despatch it, turned her nose to her master&rsquo;s face, and
fairly kissed him.&nbsp; Having given my horse his portion, I
told the old man that I was ready to taste his mead as soon as he
pleased, whereupon he ushered me into his cottage, where, making
me sit down by a deal table in a neatly-sanded kitchen, he
produced from an old-fashioned closet a bottle, holding about a
quart, and a couple of cups, which might each contain about half
a pint, then opening the bottle and filling the cups with a
brown-coloured liquor, he handed one to me, and taking a seat
opposite to me, he lifted the other, nodded, and saying to
me&mdash;&lsquo;Health and welcome,&rsquo; placed it to his lips
and drank.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Health and thanks,&rsquo; I replied; and being very
thirsty, emptied my cup at a draught; I had scarcely done so,
however, when I half repented.&nbsp; The mead was deliciously
sweet and mellow, but appeared strong as brandy; my eyes reeled
in my head, and my brain became slightly dizzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mead
is a strong drink,&rsquo; said the old man, as he looked at me,
with a half smile on his, countenance.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is, at
any rate,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;so strong indeed, that I would
not drink another cup for any consideration.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And I would not ask you,&rsquo; said the old man;
&lsquo;for, if you did, you would most probably be <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>stupid all day, and wake next morning with a
headache.&nbsp; Mead is a good drink, but woundily strong,
especially to those who be not used to it, as I suppose you are
not?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where do you get it?&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I make it myself,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;from the honey which my bees make.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Have you many bees?&rsquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
great many,&rsquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;And do you keep
them,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for the sake of making mead with
their honey?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I keep them,&rsquo; he replied,
&lsquo;partly because I am fond of them, and partly for what they
bring me in; they make me a great deal of honey, some of which I
sell, and with a little I make me some mead to warm my poor heart
with, or occasionally to treat a friend with like
yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And do you support yourself
entirely by means of your bees?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said the old man; &lsquo;I have a little bit of ground behind my
house, which is my principal means of support.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And do you live alone?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;with the exception of the bees and the donkey, I
live quite alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And have you always lived
alone?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man emptied his cup, and his heart
being warmed with the mead, he told me his history, which was
simplicity itself.&nbsp; His father was a small yeoman, who, at
his death had left him, his only child, the cottage, with a small
piece of ground behind it, and on this little property he had
lived ever since.&nbsp; About the age of twenty-five he had
married an industrious young woman, by whom he had one daughter,
who died before reaching years of womanhood.&nbsp; His wife,
however, had survived her daughter many years, and had been a
great comfort to him, assisting him in his rural occupations;
but, about four years before the present period, he had lost her,
since which time he had lived alone, making himself as
comfortable as he could; cultivating his ground, with the help of
a lad from the neighbouring village, attending to his bees, and
occasionally riding his donkey to market, and hearing the word of
God, which he said he was sorry he could not read, twice a week
regularly at the parish church.&nbsp; Such was the old
man&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>When he had finished speaking, he led me behind his house, and
showed me his little domain.&nbsp; It consisted of about two
acres in admirable cultivation; a small portion of it formed a
kitchen garden, whilst the rest was sown with four kinds of
grain, wheat, barley, pease, <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>and
beans.&nbsp; The air was full of ambrosial sweets, resembling
those proceeding from an orange grove; a place which, though I
had never seen at that time, I since have.&nbsp; In the garden
was the habitation of the bees, a long box, supported upon three
oaken stumps.&nbsp; It was full of small round glass windows, and
appeared to be divided into a great many compartments, much
resembling drawers placed sideways.&nbsp; He told me that, as one
compartment was filled, the bees left it for another, so that
whenever he wanted honey, he could procure some without injuring
the insects.&nbsp; Through the little round windows I could see
several of the bees at work; hundreds were going in and out of
the doors; hundreds were buzzing about on the flowers, the
woodbines, and beans.&nbsp; As I looked around on the
well-cultivated field, the garden, and the bees, I thought I had
never before seen so rural and peaceful a scene.</p>
<p>When we returned to the cottage we again sat down, and I asked
the old man whether he was not afraid to live alone.&nbsp; He
told me that he was not, for that, upon the whole, his neighbours
were very kind to him.&nbsp; I mentioned the fellow who had
swindled him of his donkey upon the road.&nbsp; &lsquo;That was
no neighbour of mine,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;and,
perhaps, I shall never see him again or his like.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to have
no other resource, when injured, than to shed tears on the
road.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is so,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;but God saw the tears of the old, and sent a
helper.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you not help yourself?&rsquo;
said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Instead of getting off your ass, why did you
not punch at the fellow, or at any rate use dreadful language,
call him villain, and shout robbery?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Punch!&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;shout! what, with
these hands, and this voice&mdash;Lord, how, you run on!&nbsp; I
am old, young chap, I am old!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;it is a shameful thing to cry even when
old.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You think so now,&rsquo; said the old
man, &lsquo;because you are young and strong; perhaps, when you
are as old as I, you will not be ashamed to cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon the whole I was rather pleased with the old man, and much
with all about him.&nbsp; As evening drew nigh, I told him that I
must proceed on my journey; whereupon he invited me to tarry with
him during the night, telling me that he had a nice room and bed
above at my service.&nbsp; I, however, declined; and bidding him
farewell, mounted <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>my horse, and departed.&nbsp;
Regaining the road, I proceeded once more in the direction of the
north; and, after a few hours, coming to a comfortable
public-house, I stopped and put up for the night.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>THE SINGULAR NOISE&mdash;SLEEPING IN A MEADOW&mdash;THE
BOOK&mdash;CURE FOR WAKEFULNESS&mdash;LITERARY
TEA-PARTY&mdash;POOR BYRON</p>
<p>I did not awake till rather late the next morning; and when I
did, I felt considerable drowsiness, with a slight headache,
which I was uncharitable enough to attribute to the mead which I
had drank on the preceding day.&nbsp; After feeding my horse, and
breakfasting, I proceeded on my wanderings.&nbsp; Nothing
occurred worthy of relating till mid-day was considerably past,
when I came to a pleasant valley, between two gentle hills.&nbsp;
I had dismounted, in order to ease my horse, and was leading him
along by the bridle, when, on my right, behind a bank in which
some umbrageous ashes were growing, I heard a singular
noise.&nbsp; I stopped short and listened, and presently said to
myself, &lsquo;Surely this is snoring, perhaps that of a
hedgehog.&rsquo;&nbsp; On further consideration, however, I was
convinced that the noise which I heard, and which certainly
seemed to be snoring, could not possibly proceed from the
nostrils of so small an animal, but must rather come from those
of a giant, so loud and sonorous was it.&nbsp; About two or three
yards further was a gate, partly open, to which I went, and
peeping into the field, saw a man lying on some rich grass, under
the shade of one of the ashes; he was snoring away at a great
rate.&nbsp; Impelled by curiosity, I fastened the bridle of my
horse to the gate, and went up to the man.&nbsp; He was a
genteely-dressed individual, rather corpulent, with dark
features, and seemingly about forty-five.&nbsp; He lay on his
back, his hat slightly over his brow, and at his right hand lay
an open book.&nbsp; So strenuously did he snore that the wind
from his nostrils agitated, perceptibly, a fine cambric frill
which he wore at his bosom.&nbsp; I gazed upon him for some time,
expecting that he might awake; but he did not, but kept on
snoring, his breast heaving convulsively.&nbsp; At last, the <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>noise he made became so terrible, that I felt alarmed
for his safety, imagining that a fit might seize him, and he lose
his life whilst asleep.&nbsp; I therefore exclaimed, &lsquo;Sir,
sir, awake! you sleep overmuch.&rsquo;&nbsp; But my voice failed
to rouse him, and he continued snoring as before; whereupon I
touched him slightly with my riding wand, but failing to wake
him, I touched him again more vigorously; whereupon he opened his
eyes, and, probably imagining himself in a dream, closed them
again.&nbsp; But I was determined to arouse him, and cried as
loud as I could, &lsquo;Sir, sir, pray sleep no
more!&rsquo;&nbsp; He heard what I said, opened his eyes again,
stared at me with a look of some consciousness, and, half raising
himself upon his elbows, asked me what was the matter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but I took the
liberty of awaking you because you appeared to be much disturbed
in your sleep&mdash;I was fearful, too, that you might catch a
fever from sleeping under a tree.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I run no
risk,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;I often come and sleep here;
and as for being disturbed in my sleep, I felt very comfortable;
I wish you had not awoken me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;I beg your pardon once more.&nbsp; I assure you
that what I did was with the best intention.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh! pray make no farther apology,&rsquo; said the
individual, &lsquo;I make no doubt that what you did was done
kindly; but there&rsquo;s an old proverb, to the effect,
&ldquo;that you should let sleeping dogs lie,&rdquo;&rsquo; he
added, with a smile.&nbsp; Then, getting up, and stretching
himself with a yawn, he took up his book and said, &lsquo;I have
slept quite long enough, and it&rsquo;s quite time for me to be
going home.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Excuse my curiosity,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;if I inquire what may induce you to come and sleep in
this meadow?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;To tell you the truth,&rsquo;
answered he, &lsquo;I am a bad sleeper.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray
pardon me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I tell you that I never saw
one sleep more heartily.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If I did so,&rsquo;
said the individual, &lsquo;I am beholden to this meadow and this
book; but I am talking riddles, and will explain myself.&nbsp; I
am the owner of a very pretty property, of which this valley
forms part.&nbsp; Some years ago, however, up started a person
who said the property was his; a lawsuit ensued, and I was on the
brink of losing my all, when, most unexpectedly, the suit was
determined in my favour.&nbsp; Owing, however, to the anxiety to
which my mind had been subjected for years, my nerves had become
terribly shaken; and no sooner was the trial terminated than
sleep forsook my pillow.&nbsp; I sometimes passed nights <!--
page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>without closing an eye; I took opiates, but they rather
increased than alleviated my malady.&nbsp; About three weeks ago
a friend of mine put this book into my hand, and advised me to
take it every day to some pleasant part of my estate, and try and
read a page or two, assuring me, if I did that I should
infallibly fall asleep.&nbsp; I took his advice, and selecting
this place, which I considered the pleasantest part of my
property, I came, and lying down, commenced reading the book, and
before finishing a page was in a dead slumber.&nbsp; Every day
since then I have repeated the experiment, and every time with
equal success.&nbsp; I am a single man, without any children; and
yesterday I made my will, in which, in the event of my
friend&rsquo;s surviving me, I have left him all my fortune, in
gratitude for his having procured for me the most invaluable of
all blessings&mdash;sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how very
extraordinary!&nbsp; Do you think that your going to sleep is
caused by the meadow or the book?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose
by both,&rsquo; said my new acquaintance, &lsquo;acting in
co-operation.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It may be so,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;the magic influence does certainly not proceed from the
meadow alone; for since I have been here, I have not felt the
slightest inclination to sleep.&nbsp; Does the book consist of
prose or poetry?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It consists of
poetry,&rsquo; said the individual.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not
Byron&rsquo;s?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Byron&rsquo;s!&rsquo;
repeated the individual, with a smile of contempt; &lsquo;no, no;
there is nothing narcotic in Byron&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I used to read it, but it thrilled,
agitated, and kept me awake.&nbsp; No, this is not Byron&rsquo;s
poetry, but the inimitable ---&rsquo;s <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a>&mdash;mentioning a name which I had
never heard till then.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you permit me to look at
it?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;With pleasure,&rsquo; he
answered, politely handing me the book. <a
name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b"
class="citation">[138b]</a>&nbsp; I took the volume, and glanced
over the contents.&nbsp; It was written in blank verse, and
appeared to abound in descriptions of scenery; there was much
mention of mountains, valleys, streams, and waterfalls, harebells
and daffodils.&nbsp; These descriptions were interspersed with
dialogues, which, though they proceeded from the mouths of
pedlars and rustics, were of the most edifying description;
mostly on subjects moral or metaphysical, and couched in the most
gentlemanly and unexceptionable language, without the slightest
mixture of vulgarity, coarseness, or pie-bald grammar.&nbsp; Such
appeared to me <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>to be the contents of the book; but
before I could form a very clear idea of them, I found myself
nodding, and a surprising desire to sleep coming over me.&nbsp;
Rousing myself, however, by a strong effort, I closed the book,
and, returning it to the owner, inquired of him, &lsquo;Whether
he had any motive in coming and lying down in the meadow, besides
the wish of enjoying sleep?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;None
whatever,&rsquo; he replied; &lsquo;indeed, I should be very glad
not to be compelled to do so, always provided I could enjoy the
blessing of sleep; for by lying down under trees, I may possibly
catch the rheumatism, or be stung by serpents; and, moreover, in
the rainy season and winter the thing will be impossible, unless
I erect a tent, which will possibly destroy the
charm.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you need
give yourself no farther trouble about coming here, as I am fully
convinced that with this book in your hand, you may go to sleep
anywhere, as your friend was doubtless aware, though he wished to
interest your imagination for a time by persuading you to lie
abroad; therefore, in future, whenever you feel disposed to
sleep, try to read the book, and you will be sound asleep in a
minute; the narcotic influence lies in the book, and not in the
field.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will follow your advice,&rsquo; said
the individual, &lsquo;and this very night take it with me to
bed; though I hope in time to be able to sleep without it, my
nerves being already much quieted from the slumbers I have
enjoyed in this field.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then moved towards the
gate, where we parted; he going one way, and I and my horse the
other.</p>
<p>More than twenty years subsequent to this period, after much
wandering about the world, returning to my native country, I was
invited to a literary tea-party, where, the discourse turning
upon poetry, I, in order to show that I was not more ignorant
than my neighbours, began to talk about Byron, for whose writings
I really entertained a considerable admiration, though I had no
particular esteem for the man himself.&nbsp; At first I received
no answer to what I said&mdash;the company merely surveying me
with a kind of sleepy stare.&nbsp; At length a lady, about the
age of forty, with a large wart on her face, observed, in a
drawling tone, &lsquo;That she had not read Byron&mdash;at least
since her girlhood&mdash;and then only a few passages; but that
the impression on her mind was, that his writings were of a
highly objectionable character.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I also read a
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>little of him in my boyhood,&rsquo; said a gentleman,
about sixty, but who evidently, from his dress and demeanour,
wished to appear about thirty, &lsquo;but I highly disapproved of
him; for, notwithstanding he was a nobleman, he is frequently
very coarse, and very fond of raising emotion.&nbsp; Now emotion
is what I dislike;&rsquo; drawling out the last syllable of the
word dislike.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is only one poet for
me&mdash;the divine ---&rsquo;; and then he mentioned a name
which I had only once heard, and afterwards quite forgotten; the
name mentioned by the snorer in the field.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! there
is no one like him!&rsquo; murmured some more of the company;
&lsquo;the poet of nature&mdash;of nature without its
vulgarity.&rsquo;&nbsp; I wished very much to ask these people
whether they were ever bad sleepers, and whether they had read
the poet, so called, from a desire of being set to sleep.&nbsp;
Within a few days, however, I learnt that it had of late become
very fashionable and genteel to appear half asleep, and that one
could exhibit no better mark of superfine breeding than by
occasionally in company setting one&rsquo;s ronchal organ in
action.&nbsp; I then ceased to wonder at the popularity, which I
found nearly universal, of ---&rsquo;s poetry; for, certainly in
order to make one&rsquo;s self appear sleepy in company, or
occasionally to induce sleep, nothing could be more efficacious
than a slight pre-lection of his poems.&nbsp; So, poor Byron,
with his fire and emotion&mdash;to say nothing of his mouthings
and coxcombry&mdash;was dethroned, as I had prophesied he would
be more than twenty years before, on the day of his funeral,
though I had little idea that his humiliation would have been
brought about by one, whose sole strength consists in setting
people to sleep.&nbsp; Well, all things are doomed to terminate
in sleep.&nbsp; Before that termination, however, I will venture
to prophesy that people will become a little more
awake&mdash;snoring and yawning be a little less in
fashion&mdash;and poor Byron be once more reinstated on his
throne, though his rival will always stand a good chance of being
worshipped by those whose ruined nerves are insensible to the
narcotic powers of opium and morphine.</p>

<p>DRIVERS AND FRONT OUTSIDE PASSENGERS&mdash;FATIGUE OF BODY AND
MIND&mdash;UNEXPECTED GREETING&mdash;MY INN&mdash;THE
GOVERNOR&mdash;ENGAGEMENT</p>
<p>I continued my journey, passing through one or two
villages.&nbsp; The day was exceedingly hot, and the roads
dusty.&nbsp; In order to cause my horse as little fatigue as
possible, and not to chafe his back, I led him by the bridle, my
doing which brought upon me a shower of remarks, jests, and
would-be witticisms from the drivers and front outside passengers
of sundry stage-coaches, which passed me in one direction or the
other.&nbsp; In this way I proceeded till considerably past noon,
when I felt myself very fatigued, and my horse appeared no less
so; and it is probable that the lazy and listless manner in which
we were moving on tired us both much more effectually than
hurrying along at a swift trot would have done, for I have
observed that when the energies of the body are not exerted a
languor frequently comes over it.&nbsp; At length, arriving at a
very large building with an archway, near the entrance of a town,
<a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a> I sat down on what appeared to be a
stepping-block, and presently experienced a great depression of
spirits.&nbsp; I began to ask myself whither I was going, and
what I should do with myself and the horse which I held by the
bridle?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I was alone in the world
with the poor animal, who looked for support to me, who knew not
how to support myself.&nbsp; Then the image of Isopel Berners
came into my mind, and when I bethought me how I had lost her for
ever, and how happy I might have been with her in the New World
had she not deserted me, I became yet more miserable.</p>
<p>As I sat in this state of mind, I suddenly felt some one clap
me on the shoulder, and heard a voice say: &lsquo;Ha! comrade of
the dingle, what chance has brought you into these
parts?&rsquo;&nbsp; I turned round, and beheld a man in the dress
of a postillion, whom I instantly recognised as he to <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>whom I had rendered assistance on the night of the
storm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is it you?&nbsp; I am glad to
see you, for I was feeling very lonely and melancholy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lonely and melancholy,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;how is
that? how can anyone be lonely and melancholy with such a noble
horse as that you hold by the bridle?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The horse,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is one cause of my
melancholy, for I know not in the world what to do with
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it your own?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I may call it my own, though
I borrowed the money to purchase it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you sell it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not always easy to find a purchaser for a horse
like this,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;can you recommend me
one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I?&nbsp; Why, no, not exactly: but you&rsquo;ll find a
purchaser shortly&mdash;pooh!&nbsp; If you have no other cause
for disquiet than that horse, cheer up, man; don&rsquo;t be cast
down.&nbsp; Have you nothing else on your mind?&nbsp; By-the-by,
what&rsquo;s become of the young woman you were keeping company
with in that queer lodging-place of yours?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has left me,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You quarrelled, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;we did not exactly quarrel,
but we are parted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;but you will soon come
together again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;we are parted for
ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For ever!&nbsp; Pooh! you little know how people
sometimes come together again who think they are parted for
ever.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s something on that point relating to
myself.&nbsp; You remember when I told you my story in that
dingle of yours, that I mentioned a young woman, my
fellow-servant when I lived with the English family in Mumbo
Jumbo&rsquo;s town, and how she and I, when our foolish governors
were thinking of changing their religion, agreed to stand by each
other, and be true to old Church of England, and to give our
governors warning, provided they tried to make us
renegades.&nbsp; Well, she and I parted soon after that, and
never thought to meet again, yet we met the other day in the
fields, for she lately came to live with a great family not far
from here, and we have since agreed to marry, to take a little
farm, for we have both a trifle of money, and live together till
&ldquo;death us do part.&rdquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>So much for
parting for ever!&nbsp; But what do I mean by keeping you
broiling in the sun with your horse&rsquo;s bridle in your hand,
and you on my own ground?&nbsp; Do you know where you are?&nbsp;
Why, that great house is my inn, that is, it&rsquo;s my
master&rsquo;s, the best fellow in ---.&nbsp; Come along, you and
your horse both will find a welcome at my inn.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he led the way into a large court, in which there
were coaches, chaises, and a great many people; taking my horse
from me, he led it into a nice cool stall, and fastening it to
the rack, he then conducted me into a postillion&rsquo;s
keeping-room, which at that time chanced to be empty, and he then
fetched a pot of beer and sat down by me.</p>
<p>After a little conversation he asked me what I intended to do,
and I told him frankly that I did not know, whereupon he observed
that, provided I had no objection, he had little doubt that I
could be accommodated for some time at his inn.&nbsp; &lsquo;Our
upper ostler,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;died about a week ago; he
was a clever fellow, and besides his trade understood reading and
accounts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said I, interrupting him, &lsquo;I am
not fitted for the place of ostler&mdash;moreover, I refused the
place of ostler at a public-house, which was offered to me only a
few days ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; The postillion burst into a
laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ostler at a public-house, indeed!&nbsp; Why,
you would not compare a berth at a place like that with the
situation of ostler at my inn, the first road-house in
England!&nbsp; However, I was not thinking of the place of ostler
for you; you are, as you say, not fitted for it, at any rate, not
at a house like this.&nbsp; We have, moreover, the best
under-ostler in all England&mdash;old Bill, with the drawback
that he is rather fond of drink.&nbsp; We could make shift with
him very well provided we could fall in with a man of writing and
figures, who could give an account of the hay and corn which
comes in and goes out, and wouldn&rsquo;t object to give a look
occasionally at the yard.&nbsp; Now it appears to me that you are
just such a kind of man, and if you will allow me to speak to the
governor, I don&rsquo;t doubt that he will gladly take you, as he
feels kindly disposed towards you from what he has heard me say
concerning you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what should I do with my horse?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The horse need give you no uneasiness,&rsquo; said the
postillion: &lsquo;I know he will be welcome here both for bed
and manger, and perhaps in a little time you may find a <!-- page
144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>purchaser, as a vast number of sporting people frequent
this house.&rsquo;&nbsp; I offered two or three more objections,
which the postillion overcame with great force of argument, and
the pot being nearly empty, he drained it to the bottom drop, and
then starting up, left me alone.</p>
<p>In about twenty minutes he returned, accompanied by a highly
intelligent looking individual dressed in blue and black, with a
particularly white cravat, and without a hat on his head; this
individual, whom I should have mistaken for a gentleman but for
the intelligence depicted in his face, he introduced to me as the
master of the inn.&nbsp; The master of the inn shook me warmly by
the hand, told me that he was happy to see me in his house, and
thanked me in the handsomest terms for the kindness I had shown
to his servant in the affair of the thunder-storm.&nbsp; Then
saying that he was informed I was out of employ, he assured me
that he should be most happy to engage me to keep his hay and
corn account, and as general superintendent of the yard, and that
with respect to the horse, which he was told I had, he begged to
inform me that I was perfectly at liberty to keep it at the inn
upon the very best, until I could find a purchaser; that with
regard to wages&mdash;but he had no sooner mentioned wages than I
cut him short, saying that provided I stayed I should be most
happy to serve him for bed and board, and requested that he would
allow me until the next morning to consider of his offer; he
willingly consented to my request, and, begging that I would call
for anything I pleased, left me alone with the postillion.</p>
<p>I passed that night until about ten o&rsquo;clock with the
postillion, when he left me, having to drive a family about ten
miles across the country; before his departure, however, I told
him that I had determined to accept the offer of his governor, as
he called him.&nbsp; At the bottom of my heart I was most happy
that an offer had been made, which secured to myself and the
animal a comfortable retreat at a moment when I knew not whither
in the world to take myself and him.</p>

<p>AN INN OF TIMES GONE BY&mdash;A FIRST-RATE PUBLICAN&mdash;HAY
AND CORN&mdash;OLD-FASHIONED
OSTLER&mdash;HIGHWAYMEN&mdash;MOUNTED POLICE&mdash;GROOMING</p>
<p>The inn of which I had become an inhabitant was a place of
infinite life and bustle.&nbsp; Travellers of all descriptions,
from all the cardinal points, were continually stopping at it:
and to attend to their wants, and minister to their convenience,
an army of servants, of one description or other, was
kept&mdash;waiters, chambermaids, grooms, postillions,
shoe-blacks, cooks, scullions, and what not, for there was a
barber and hair-dresser, who had been at Paris, and talked French
with a cockney accent, the French sounding all the better, as no
accent is so melodious as the cockney.&nbsp; Jacks creaked in the
kitchens turning round spits, on which large joints of meat piped
and smoked before the great big fires.&nbsp; There was running up
and down stairs, and along galleries, slamming of doors, cries of
&lsquo;Coming, sir,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Please to step this way,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; during eighteen hours of the
four-and-twenty.&nbsp; Truly a very great place for life and
bustle was this inn.&nbsp; And often in after life, when lonely
and melancholy, I have called up the time I spent there, and
never failed to become cheerful from the recollection.</p>
<p>I found the master of the house a very kind and civil
person.&nbsp; Before being an innkeeper he had been in some other
line of business, but, on the death of the former proprietor of
the inn had married his widow, who was still alive, but being
somewhat infirm, lived in a retired part of the house.&nbsp; I
have said that he was kind and civil; he was, however, not one of
those people who suffer themselves to be made fools of by
anybody; he knew his customers, and had a calm clear eye, which
would look through a man without seeming to do so.&nbsp; The
accommodation of his house was of the very best description; his
wines were good, his viands equally so, and his charges not
immoderate; though he very properly took care of himself.&nbsp;
He was no vulgar innkeeper, had a host of friends, and deserved
them all.&nbsp; During the time I lived with him, he was
presented, by a large assemblage of his friends and customers,
with a dinner at his own <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>house,
which was very costly, and at which the best of wines were
sported, and after the dinner with a piece of plate, estimated at
fifty guineas.&nbsp; He received the plate, made a neat speech of
thanks, and when the bill was called for, made another neat
speech, in which he refused to receive one farthing for the
entertainment, ordering in at the same time two dozen more of the
best champagne, and sitting down amidst uproarious applause, and
cries of &lsquo;You shall be no loser by it!&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing
very wonderful in such conduct, some people will say; I
don&rsquo;t say there is, nor have I any intention to endeavour
to persuade the reader that the landlord was a Carlo Borromeo; he
merely gave a quid pro quo; but it is not every person who will
give you a quid pro quo.&nbsp; Had he been a vulgar publican, he
would have sent in a swinging bill after receiving the plate;
&lsquo;but then no vulgar publican would have been presented with
plate;&rsquo; perhaps not, but many a vulgar public character has
been presented with plate, whose admirers never received a quid
pro quo, except in the shape of a swinging bill.</p>
<p>I found my duties of distributing hay and corn, and keeping an
account thereof, anything but disagreeable, particularly after I
had acquired the good-will of the old ostler, who at first looked
upon me with rather an evil eye, considering me somewhat in the
light of one who had usurped an office which belonged to himself
by the right of succession; but there was little gall in the old
fellow, and, by speaking kindly to him, never giving myself any
airs of assumption; but above all, by frequently reading the
newspapers to him&mdash;for, though passionately fond of news and
politics, he was unable to read&mdash;I soon succeeded in placing
myself on excellent terms with him.&nbsp; A regular character was
that old ostler; he was a Yorkshireman by birth, but had seen a
great deal of life in the vicinity of London, to which, on the
death of his parents, who were very poor people, he went at a
very early age.&nbsp; Amongst other places where he had served as
ostler was a small inn at Hounslow, much frequented by
highwaymen, whose exploits he was fond of narrating, especially
those of Jerry Abershaw, <a name="citation146"></a><a
href="#footnote146" class="citation">[146]</a> who, he said, was
a capital rider; and on hearing his accounts <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of that
worthy I half regretted that the old fellow had not been in
London, and I had not formed his acquaintance about the time I
was thinking of writing the life of the said Abershaw, not
doubting that with his assistance I could have produced a book at
least as remarkable as the life and adventures of that entirely
imaginary personage, Joseph Sell; perhaps, however, I was
mistaken; and whenever Abershaw&rsquo;s life shall appear before
the public&mdash;and my publisher credibly informs me that it has
not yet appeared&mdash;I beg and entreat the public to state
which it likes best, the life of Abershaw, or that of Sell, for
which latter work I am informed that during the last few months
there has been a prodigious demand. <a name="citation147a"></a><a
href="#footnote147a" class="citation">[147a]</a>&nbsp; My old
friend, however, after talking of Abershaw, would frequently add,
that, good rider as Abershaw certainly was, he was decidedly
inferior to Richard Ferguson, <a name="citation147b"></a><a
href="#footnote147b" class="citation">[147b]</a> generally called
Galloping Dick, who was a pal of Abershaw&rsquo;s, and had
enjoyed a career as long, and nearly as remarkable, as his
own.&nbsp; I learned from him that both were capital customers at
the Hounslow inn, and that he had frequently drank with them in
the corn-room.&nbsp; He said that no man could desire more jolly
or entertaining companions over a glass of &lsquo;summat&rsquo;;
but that upon the road it was anything but desirable to meet
them; there they were terrible, cursing and swearing, and
thrusting the muzzles of their pistols into people&rsquo;s
mouths; and at this part of his locution the old man winked, and
said, in a somewhat lower voice, that upon the whole they were
right in doing so, and that when a person had once made up his
mind to become a highwayman, his best policy was to go the whole
hog, fearing nothing, but making everybody afraid of him; that
people never thought of resisting a savage-faced, foul-mouthed
highwayman, and if he were taken, were afraid to bear witness
against him, lest he should get off and cut their throats some
time or other upon the roads; whereas people would resist being
robbed by a sneaking, pale-visaged rascal, and would swear bodily
against him on the first opportunity; adding, that Abershaw and
Ferguson, two most awful fellows, had enjoyed a long career,
whereas two disbanded officers of the army, who wished to rob a
coach like gentlemen, <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>had begged the passengers&rsquo;
pardon, and talked of hard necessity, had been set upon by the
passengers themselves, amongst whom were three women, pulled from
their horses, conducted to Maidstone, and hanged with as little
pity as such contemptible fellows deserved.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is
nothing like going the whole hog,&rsquo; he repeated, &lsquo;and
if ever I had been a highwayman, I would have done so; I should
have thought myself all the more safe; and, moreover,
shouldn&rsquo;t have despised myself.&nbsp; To curry favour with
those you are robbing, sometimes at the expense of your own
comrades, as I have known fellows do, why it is the
greatest&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; interposed my friend the postillion,
who chanced to be present at a considerable part of the old
ostler&rsquo;s discourse; &lsquo;it is, as you say, the greatest
of humbug, and merely, after all, gets a fellow into trouble; but
no regular bred highwayman would do it.&nbsp; I say, George,
catch the Pope of Rome trying to curry favour with anybody he
robs; catch old Mumbo Jumbo currying favour with the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Dean and Chapter, should he meet them in a
stage-coach; it would be with him, Bricconi Abbasso, as he
knocked their teeth out with the butt of his trombone, and the
old regular-built ruffian would be all the safer for it, as Bill
would say, as ten to one the Archbishop and Chapter, after such a
spice of his quality, would be afraid to swear against him, and
to hang him, even if he were in their power, though that would be
the proper way; for, if it is the greatest of all humbug for a
highwayman to curry favour with those he robs, the next greatest
is to try to curry favour with a highwayman when you have got
him, by letting him off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Finding the old man so well acquainted with the history of
highwaymen, and taking considerable interest in the subject,
having myself edited a book <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a> containing the
lives of many remarkable people who had figured on the highway, I
forthwith asked him how it was that the trade of highwayman had
become extinct in England, as at present we never heard of anyone
following it.&nbsp; Whereupon he told me that many causes had
contributed to bring about that result; the principal of which
were the following: the refusal to license houses which were
known to afford shelter to highwaymen, which, amongst many <!--
page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>others, had caused the inn at Hounslow to be closed;
the inclosure of many a wild heath in the country, on which they
were in the habit of lurking, and particularly the establishing
in the neighbourhood of London of a well-armed mounted patrol,
who rode the highwaymen down, and delivered them up to justice,
which hanged them without ceremony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that would be the way to deal with Mumbo Jumbo and
his gang,&rsquo; said the postillion, &lsquo;should they show
their visages in these realms; and I hear by the newspapers that
they are becoming every day more desperate.&nbsp; Take away the
license from their public-houses, cut down the rookeries and
shadowy old avenues in which they are fond of lying in wait, in
order to sally out upon people as they pass in the roads; but,
above all, establish a good mounted police to ride after the
ruffians and drag them by the scruff of the neck to the next
clink, <a name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149"
class="citation">[149]</a> where they might lie till they could
be properly dealt with by law; instead of which, the Government
are repealing the wise old laws enacted against such characters,
giving fresh licenses every day to their public-houses, and
saying that it would be a pity to cut down their rookeries and
thickets, because they look so very picturesque; and, in fact,
giving them all kind of encouragement; why, if such behaviour is
not enough to drive an honest man mad, I know not what is.&nbsp;
It is of no use talking, I only wish the power were in my hands,
and if I did not make short work of them, might I be a mere
jackass postillion all the remainder of my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Besides acquiring from the ancient ostler a great deal of
curious information respecting the ways and habits of the heroes
of the road, with whom he had come in contact in the early
portion of his life, I picked up from him many excellent hints
relating to the art of grooming horses.&nbsp; Whilst at the inn,
I frequently groomed the stage and post-horses, and those driven
up by travellers in their gigs: I was not compelled, nor indeed
expected, to do so; but I took pleasure in the occupation; and I
remember at that period one of the principal objects of my
ambition was to be a first-rate groom, and to make the skins of
the creatures I took in hand look sleek and glossy like those of
moles.&nbsp; I have said that I derived <!-- page 150--><a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>valuable
hints from the old man, and, indeed, became a very tolerable
groom, but there was a certain finishing touch which I could
never learn from him, though he possessed it himself, and which I
could never attain to by my own endeavours; though my want of
success certainly did not proceed from want of application, for I
have rubbed the horses down, purring and buzzing all the time,
after the genuine ostler fashion, until the perspiration fell in
heavy drops upon my shoes, and when I had done my best, and asked
the old fellow what he thought of my work, I could never extract
from him more than a kind of grunt, which might be translated:
&lsquo;Not so very bad, but I have seen a horse groomed much
better,&rsquo; which leads me to suppose that a person, in order
to be a first-rate groom, must have something in him when he is
born which I had not, and, indeed, which many other people have
not who pretend to be grooms.&nbsp; What does the reader
think?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>STABLE HARTSHORN&mdash;HOW TO MANAGE A HORSE ON A
JOURNEY&mdash;YOUR BEST FRIEND</p>
<p>Of one thing I am certain, that the reader must be much
delighted with the wholesome smell of the stable, with which many
of these pages are redolent; what a contrast to the sickly odours
exhaled from those of some of my contemporaries, especially of
those who pretend to be of the highly fashionable class, and who
treat of reception-rooms, well may they be styled so, in which
dukes, duchesses, earls, countesses, archbishops, bishops,
mayors, mayoresses&mdash;not forgetting the writers themselves,
both male and female&mdash;congregate and press upon one another;
how cheering, how refreshing, after having been nearly knocked
down with such an atmosphere, to come in contact with genuine
stable hartshorn.&nbsp; Oh! the reader shall have yet more of the
stable, and of that old ostler, for which he or she will
doubtless exclaim, &lsquo;Much obliged!&rsquo;&mdash;and lest I
should forget to perform my promise, the reader shall have it
now.</p>
<p>I shall never forget an harangue from the mouth of the old
man, which I listened to one warm evening as he and <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>I
sat on the threshold of the stable, after having attended to some
of the wants of a batch of coach-horses.&nbsp; It related to the
manner in which a gentleman should take care of his horse and
self, whilst engaged in a journey on horseback, and was addressed
to myself, on the supposition of my one day coming to an estate,
and of course becoming a gentleman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you are a gentleman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;should
you ever wish to take a journey on a horse of your own, and you
could not have a much better than the one you have here eating
its fill in the box yonder&mdash;I wonder by-the-by, how you ever
came by it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do better than follow the advice
I am about to give you, both with respect to your animal and
yourself.&nbsp; Before you start, merely give your horse a couple
of handfuls of corn, and a little water, somewhat under a quart,
and if you drink a pint of water yourself out of the pail, you
will feel all the better during the whole day; then you may walk
and trot your animal for about ten miles, till you come to some
nice inn, where you may get down and see your horse led into a
nice stall, telling the ostler not to feed him till you
come.&nbsp; If the ostler happens to be a dog-fancier, and has an
English terrier dog like that of mine there, say what a nice dog
it is, and praise its black and tawn; and if he does not happen
to be a dog-fancier, ask him how he&rsquo;s getting on, and
whether he ever knew worse times; that kind of thing will please
the ostler, and he will let you do just what you please with your
own horse, and when your back is turned, he&rsquo;ll say to his
comrades what a nice gentleman you are, and how he thinks he has
seen you before; then go and sit down to breakfast, and before
you have finished breakfast, get up and go and give your horse a
feed of corn, chat with the ostler two or three minutes till your
horse has taken the shine out of his corn, which will prevent the
ostler taking any of it away when your back is turned, for such
things are sometimes done&mdash;not that I ever did such a thing
myself when I was at the inn at Hounslow.&nbsp; Oh, dear me,
no!&nbsp; Then go and finish your breakfast, and when you have
finished your breakfast and called for the newspaper, go and
water your horse, letting him have about one pailful, then give
him another feed of corn, and enter into discourse with the
ostler about bull-baiting, the prime minister, and the like; and
when your horse has once more taken the shine out <!-- page
152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>of
his corn, go back to your room and your newspaper&mdash;and I
hope for your sake it may be the &ldquo;Globe,&rdquo; for
that&rsquo;s the best paper going&mdash;then pull the bell-rope
and order in your bill, which you will pay without counting it
up&mdash;supposing you to be a gentleman.&nbsp; Give the waiter
sixpence, and order out your horse, and when your horse is out,
pay for the corn, and give the ostler a shilling, then mount your
horse and walk him gently for five miles; and whilst you are
walking him in this manner, it may be as well to tell you to take
care that you do not let him down and smash his knees, more
especially if the road be a particularly good one, for it is not
at a desperate hiverman <a name="citation152"></a><a
href="#footnote152" class="citation">[152]</a> pace, and over
very bad roads, that a horse tumbles and smashes his knees, but
on your particularly nice road, when the horse is going gently
and lazily, and is half asleep, like the gemman on his back;
well, at the end of the five miles, when the horse has digested
his food, and is all right, you may begin to push your horse on,
trotting him a mile at a heat, and then walking him a quarter of
a one, that his wind may be not distressed; and you may go on in
that manner for thirty miles, never galloping of course, for none
but fools or hivermen ever gallop horses on roads; and at the end
of that distance you may stop at some other nice inn for
dinner.&nbsp; I say, when your horse is led into the stable,
after that same thirty miles trotting and walking, don&rsquo;t
let the saddle be whisked off at once, for if you do your horse
will have such a sore back as will frighten you, but let your
saddle remain on your horse&rsquo;s back, with the girths
loosened, till after his next feed of corn, and be sure that he
has no corn, much less water, till after a long hour and more;
after he is fed he may be watered to the tune of half a pail, and
then the ostler can give him a regular rub down; you may then sit
down to dinner, and when you have dined get up and see to your
horse as you did after breakfast, in fact you must do much after
the same fashion you did at t&rsquo;other inn; see to your horse,
and by no means disoblige the ostler.&nbsp; So when you have seen
to your horse a second time, you will sit down to your bottle of
wine&mdash;supposing you to be a gentleman&mdash;and after you
have finished it, and your argument about the corn-laws with any
commercial gentleman who happens to be in the room, you may mount
your horse again&mdash;not forgetting to do the <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>proper thing to the waiter and ostler; you may mount
your horse again and ride him, as you did before, for about
five-and-twenty miles, at the end of which you may put up for the
night after a very fair day&rsquo;s journey, for no
gentleman&mdash;supposing he weighs sixteen stone, as I suppose
you will by the time you become a gentleman&mdash;ought to ride a
horse more than sixty-five miles in one day, provided he has any
regard for his horse&rsquo;s back, or his own either.&nbsp; See
to your horse at night, and have him well rubbed down.&nbsp; The
next day you may ride your horse forty miles just as you please,
but never foolishly, and those forty miles will bring you to your
journey&rsquo;s end, unless your journey be a plaguy long one,
and if so, never ride your horse more than five-and-thirty miles
a day, always, however, seeing him well fed, and taking more care
of him than yourself; which is but right and reasonable, seeing
as how the horse is the best animal of the two.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you are a gentleman,&rsquo; said he, after a
pause, &lsquo;the first thing you must think about is to provide
yourself with a good horse for your own particular riding; you
will, perhaps, keep a coach and pair, but they will be less your
own than your lady&rsquo;s, should you have one, and your young
gentry, should you have any; or, if you have neither, for madam,
your housekeeper, and the upper female servants; so you need
trouble your head less about them, though, of course, you would
not like to pay away your money for screws; but be sure you get a
good horse for your own riding; and that you may have a good
chance of having a good one, buy one that&rsquo;s young and has
plenty of belly&mdash;a little more than the one has which you
now have, though you are not yet a gentleman; you will, of
course, look to his head, his withers, legs and other points, but
never buy a horse at any price that has not plenty of belly, no
horse that has not belly is ever a good feeder, and a horse that
ain&rsquo;t a good feeder can&rsquo;t be a good horse; never buy
a horse that is drawn up in the belly behind, a horse of that
description can&rsquo;t feed, and can never carry sixteen
stone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So when you have got such a horse be proud of
it&mdash;as I dare say you are of the one you have now&mdash;and
wherever you go swear there ain&rsquo;t another to match it in
the country, and if anybody gives you the lie, take him by the
nose and tweak it off, just as you would do if anybody <!-- page
154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>were to speak ill of your lady, or, for want of her, of
your housekeeper.&nbsp; Take care of your horse as you would of
the apple of your eye&mdash;I am sure I would, if I were a
gentleman, which I don&rsquo;t ever expect to be, and hardly
wish, seeing as how I am sixty-nine, and am rather too old to
ride&mdash;yes, cherish and take care of your horse as perhaps
the best friend you have in the world; for, after all, who will
carry you through thick and thin as your horse will? not your
gentlemen friends, I warrant, nor your housekeeper, nor your
upper servants, male or female; perhaps your lady would, that is,
if she is a wopper, and one of the right sort; the others would
be more likely to take up mud and pelt you with it, provided they
saw you in trouble, than to help you.&nbsp; So take care of your
horse, and feed him every day with your own hands; give him
three-quarters of a peck of corn each day, mixed up with a little
hay-chaff, and allow him besides one hundred weight of hay in the
course of the week; some say that the hay should be hardland hay,
because it is wholesomest, but I say, let it be clover hay,
because the horse likes it best; give him through summer and
winter, once a week, a pailful of bran mash, cold in summer and
in winter hot; ride him gently about the neighbourhood every day,
by which means you will give exercise to yourself and horse, and,
moreover, have the satisfaction of exhibiting yourself and your
horse to advantage, and hearing, perhaps, the men say what a fine
horse, and the ladies saying what a fine man: never let your
groom mount your horse, as it is ten to one, if you do, your
groom will be wishing to show off before company, and will fling
your horse down.&nbsp; I was groom to a gemman before I went to
the inn at Hounslow, and flung him a horse down worth ninety
guineas, by endeavouring to show off before some ladies that I
met on the road.&nbsp; Turn your horse out to grass throughout
May and the first part of June, for then the grass is sweetest,
and the flies don&rsquo;t sting so bad as they do later in
summer; afterwards merely turn him out occasionally in the swale
of the morn and the evening; after September the grass is good
for little, lash and sour at best; every horse should go out to
grass, if not his blood becomes full of greasy humours, and his
wind is apt to become affected, but he ought to be kept as much
as possible from the heat and flies, always got up at night, and
never turned out late in the year&mdash;<!-- page 155--><a

had always such a nice attentive person to listen to me as you
are, I could go on talking about &rsquo;orses to the end of
time.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>THE STAGE-COACHMEN OF ENGLAND&mdash;A BULLY SERVED
OUT&mdash;BROUGHTON&rsquo;S GUARD&mdash;THE BRAZEN HEAD</p>
<p>I lived on very good terms, not only with the master and the
old ostler, but with all the domestics and hangers-on at the inn:
waiters, chambermaids, cooks, and scullions, not forgetting the
&lsquo;boots,&rsquo; of which there were three.&nbsp; As for the
postillions, I was sworn brother with them all, and some of them
went so far as to swear that I was the best fellow in the world;
for which high opinion entertained by them of me, I believe I was
principally indebted to the good account their comrade gave of
me, whom I had so hospitably received in the dingle.&nbsp; I
repeat that I lived on good terms with all the people connected
with the inn, and was noticed and spoken kindly to by some of the
guests&mdash;especially by that class termed commercial
travellers&mdash;all of whom were great friends and patronizers
of the landlord, and were the principal promoters of the dinner,
and subscribers to the gift of plate, which I have already spoken
of, the whole fraternity striking me as the jolliest set of
fellows imaginable, the best customers to an inn, and the most
liberal to servants; there was one description of persons,
however, frequenting the inn, which I did not like at all, and
which I did not get on well with, and these people were the
stage-coachmen.</p>
<p>The stage-coachmen of England, at the time of which I am
speaking, considered themselves mighty fine gentry, nay, I verily
believe the most important personages of the realm, and their
entertaining this high opinion of themselves can scarcely be
wondered at: they were low fellows, but masters of driving;
driving was in fashion, and sprigs of nobility used to dress as
coachmen and imitate the slang and behaviour of coachmen, from
whom occasionally they would take lessons in driving as they sat
beside them on the box, which post of honour any sprig of
nobility who happened to take a place on <!-- page 156--><a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>a coach
claimed as his unquestionable right; and then these sprigs would
smoke cigars and drink sherry with the coachmen in bar-rooms, and
on the road; and, when bidding them farewell, would give them a
guinea or a half-guinea, and shake them by the hand, so that
these fellows, being low fellows, very naturally thought no small
liquor of themselves, but would talk familiarly of their friends
lords so and so, the honourable misters so and so, and Sir Harry
and Sir Charles, and be wonderfully saucy to any one who was not
a lord, or something of the kind; and this high opinion of
themselves received daily augmentation from the servile homage
paid them by the generality of the untitled male passengers,
especially those on the fore part of the coach, who used to
contend for the honour of sitting on the box with the coachman
when no sprig was nigh to put in his claim.&nbsp; Oh! what
servile homage these craven creatures did pay these same coach
fellows, more especially after witnessing this or t&rsquo;other
act of brutality practised upon the weak and
unoffending&mdash;upon some poor friendless woman travelling with
but little money, and perhaps a brace of hungry children with
her, or upon some thin and half-starved man travelling on the
hind part of the coach from London to Liverpool with only
eighteen pence in his pocket after his fare was paid, to defray
his expenses on the road; for as the insolence of these knights
was vast, so was their rapacity enormous; they had been so long
accustomed to have crowns and half-crowns rained upon them by
their admirers and flatterers that they would look at a shilling,
for which many an honest labourer was happy to toil for ten hours
under a broiling sun, with the utmost contempt; would blow upon
it derisively, or fillip it into the air before they pocketed it;
but when nothing was given them, as would occasionally
happen&mdash;for how could they receive from those who had
nothing? and nobody was bound to give them anything, as they had
certain wages from their employers&mdash;then what a scene would
ensue!&nbsp; Truly the brutality and rapacious insolence of
English coachmen had reached a climax; it was time that these
fellows should be disenchanted, and the time&mdash;thank
Heaven!&mdash;was not far distant.&nbsp; Let the craven dastards
who used to curry favour with them, and applaud their brutality,
lament their loss now that they and their <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>vehicles
have disappeared from the roads; I, who have ever been an enemy
to insolence, cruelty, and tyranny, loathe their memory, and,
what is more, am not afraid to say so, well aware of the storm of
vituperation, partly learnt from them, which I may expect from
those who used to fall down and worship them.</p>
<p>Amongst the coachmen who frequented the inn was one who was
called &lsquo;the bang-up coachman.&rsquo;&nbsp; He drove to our
inn in the forepart of every day, one of what were called the
fast coaches, and afterwards took back the corresponding
vehicle.&nbsp; He stayed at our house about twenty minutes,
during which time the passengers of the coach which he was to
return with dined; those at least who were inclined for dinner,
and could pay for it.&nbsp; He derived his sobriquet of
&lsquo;The bang-up coachman&rsquo; partly from his being dressed
in the extremity of coach dandyism, and partly from the peculiar
insolence of his manner, and the unmerciful fashion in which he
was in the habit of lashing on the poor horses committed to his
charge.&nbsp; He was a large tall fellow, of about thirty, with a
face which, had it not been bloated by excess, and insolence and
cruelty stamped most visibly upon it, might have been called
good-looking.&nbsp; His insolence, indeed, was so great that he
was hated by all the minor fry connected with coaches along the
road upon which he drove, especially the ostlers, whom he was
continually abusing or finding fault with.&nbsp; Many was the
hearty curse which he received when his back was turned; but the
generality of people were much afraid of him, for he was a
swinging strong fellow, and had the reputation of being a
fighter, and in one or two instances had beaten in a barbarous
manner individuals who had quarrelled with him.</p>
<p>I was nearly having a fracas with this worthy.&nbsp; One day,
after he had been drinking sherry with a sprig, he swaggered into
the yard where I happened to be standing; just then a waiter came
by carrying upon a tray part of a splendid Cheshire cheese, with
a knife, plate, and napkin.&nbsp; Stopping the waiter, the
coachman cut with the knife a tolerably large lump out of the
very middle of the cheese, stuck it on the end of the knife, and
putting it to his mouth, nibbled a slight piece off it, and then,
tossing the rest away with disdain, flung the knife down upon the
tray, motioning the waiter to proceed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
wish,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you may not want before you die what
you have just flung <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>away,&rsquo; whereupon the fellow
turned furiously towards me; just then, however, his coach being
standing at the door, there was a cry for coachman, so that he
was forced to depart, contenting himself for the present with
shaking his fist at me, and threatening to serve me out on the
first opportunity; before, however, the opportunity occurred he
himself got served out in a most unexpected manner.</p>
<p>The day after this incident he drove his coach to the inn, and
after having dismounted and received the contributions of the
generality of the passengers, he strutted up, with a cigar in his
mouth, to an individual who had come with him, and who had just
asked me a question with respect to the direction of a village
about three miles off, to which he was going.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Remember the coachman,&rsquo; said the knight of the box
to this individual, who was a thin person of about sixty, with a
white hat, rather shabby black coat and buff-coloured trowsers,
and who held an umbrella and a small bundle in his hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you expect me to give you anything,&rsquo; said he to
the coachman, &lsquo;you are mistaken; I will give you
nothing.&nbsp; You have been very insolent to me as I rode behind
you on the coach, and have encouraged two or three trumpery
fellows, who rode along with you, to cut scurvy jokes at my
expense, and now you come to me for money; I am not so poor but I
could have given you a shilling had you been civil; as it is, I
will give you nothing.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! you won&rsquo;t,
won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said the coachman; &lsquo;dear me!&nbsp;
I hope I shan&rsquo;t starve because you won&rsquo;t give me
anything&mdash;a shilling!&nbsp; Why, I could afford to give you
twenty if I thought fit, you pauper!&nbsp; Civil to you, indeed!
things are come to a fine pass if I need be civil to you!&nbsp;
Do you know who you are speaking to?&nbsp; Why, the best lords in
the country are proud to speak to me.&nbsp; Why, it was only the
other day that the Marquis of --- said to me&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then he went on to say what the Marquis said to him; after
which, flinging down his cigar, he strutted up the road, swearing
to himself about paupers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say it is three miles to ---,&rsquo; said the
individual to me; &lsquo;I think I shall light my pipe, and smoke
it as I go along.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he took out from a
side-pocket a tobacco-box and short meerschaum pipe, and
implements for striking a light, filled his pipe, lighted it, and
commenced smoking.&nbsp; Presently the coachman drew near; I saw
at once that there was mischief in his eye; <!-- page 159--><a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>the man
smoking was standing with his back towards him, and he came so
nigh to him, seemingly purposely, that as he passed a puff of
smoke came of necessity against his face.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do
you mean by smoking in my face?&rsquo; said he, striking the pipe
of the elderly individual out of his mouth.&nbsp; The other,
without manifesting much surprise, said, &lsquo;I thank you; and
if you will wait a minute, I will give you a receipt for that
favour.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, gathering up his pipe, and taking off
his coat and hat, he laid them on a stepping-block which stood
near, and rubbing his hands together, he advanced towards the
coachman in an attitude of offence, holding his hands crossed
very near to his face.&nbsp; The coachman, who probably expected
anything but such a movement from a person of the age and
appearance of the individual whom he had insulted, stood for a
moment motionless with surprise; but, recollecting himself, he
pointed at him derisively with his finger; the next moment,
however, the other was close upon him, had struck aside the
extended hand with his left fist, and given him a severe blow on
the nose with his right, which he immediately followed by a
left-hand blow in the eye; then drawing his body slightly
backward, with the velocity of lightning he struck the coachman
full in the mouth, and the last blow was the severest of all, for
it cut the coachman&rsquo;s lips nearly through; blows so quickly
and sharply dealt I had never seen.&nbsp; The coachman reeled
like a fir-tree in a gale, and seemed nearly unsensed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ho! what&rsquo;s this? a fight! a fight!&rsquo; sounded
from a dozen voices, and people came running from all directions
to see what was going on.&nbsp; The coachman, coming somewhat to
himself, disencumbered himself of his coat and hat; and,
encouraged by two or three of his brothers of the whip, showed
some symptoms of fighting, endeavouring to close with his foe,
but the attempt was vain, his foe was not to be closed with; he
did not shift or dodge about, but warded off the blows of his
opponent with the greatest sang-froid, always using the guard
which I have already described, and putting in, in return, short
chopping blows with the swiftness of lightning.&nbsp; In a very
few minutes the countenance of the coachman was literally cut to
pieces, and several of his teeth were dislodged; at length he
gave in; stung with mortification, however, he repented, and
asked for another round; it was granted, to his own complete
demolition.&nbsp; The coachman did not <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>drive his
coach back that day; he did not appear on the box again for a
week; but he never held up his head afterwards.&nbsp; Before I
quitted the inn he had disappeared from the road, going no one
knew where.</p>
<p>The coachman, as I have said before, was very much disliked
upon the road, but there was an esprit de corps amongst the
coachmen, and those who stood by did not like to see their
brother chastised in such tremendous fashion.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
never saw such a fight before,&rsquo; said one.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fight! why, I don&rsquo;t call it a fight at all, this
chap here ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a scratch, whereas Tom is cut to
pieces; it is all along of that guard of his; if Tom could have
got within his guard he would have soon served the old chap
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;So he would,&rsquo; said another,
&lsquo;it was all owing to that guard.&nbsp; However, I think I
see into it, and if I had not to drive this afternoon, I would
have a turn with the old fellow and soon serve him
out.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I will fight him now for a
guinea,&rsquo; said the other coachman, half taking off his coat;
observing, however, that the elderly individual made a motion
towards him, he hitched it upon his shoulder again, and added,
&lsquo;that is, if he had not been fighting already, but as it
is, I am above taking an advantage, especially of such a poor old
creature as that.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when he had said this, he
looked around him, and there was a feeble titter of approbation
from two or three of the craven crew, who were in the habit of
currying favour with the coachmen.&nbsp; The elderly individual
looked for a moment at these last, and then said: &lsquo;To such
fellows as you I have nothing to say;&rsquo; then turning to the
coachmen, &lsquo;and as for you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;ye
cowardly bullies, I have but one word, which is, that your reign
upon the roads is nearly over, and that a time is coming when ye
will be no longer wanted or employed in your present capacity,
when ye will either have to drive dung-carts, assist as ostlers
at village ale-houses, or rot in the workhouse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
putting on his coat and hat, and taking up his bundle, not
forgetting his meerschaum, and the rest of his smoking apparatus,
he departed on his way.&nbsp; Filled with curiosity, I followed
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite astonished that you should be able to use
your hands in the way you have done,&rsquo; said I, as I walked
with this individual in the direction in which he was bound.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you how I became able to do so,&rsquo; said
the <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>elderly individual, proceeding to
fill and light his pipe as he walked along.&nbsp; &lsquo;My
father was a journeyman engraver, who lived in a very riotous
neighbourhood in the outskirts of London.&nbsp; Wishing to give
me something of an education, he sent me to a day-school, two or
three streets distant from where we lived, and there, being
rather a puny boy, I suffered much persecution from my
school-fellows, who were a very blackguard set.&nbsp; One day, as
I was running home, with one of my tormentors pursuing me, old
Sergeant Broughton, <a name="citation161"></a><a
href="#footnote161" class="citation">[161]</a> the retired
fighting-man, seized me by the arm&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;has it ever been your
luck to be acquainted with Sergeant Broughton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may well call it luck,&rsquo; said the elderly
individual; &lsquo;but for him I should never have been able to
make my way through the world.&nbsp; He lived only four doors
from our house; so, as I was running along the street, with my
tyrant behind me, Sergeant Broughton seized me by the arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stop, my boy,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have frequently
seen that scamp ill-treating you; now I will teach you how to
send him home with a bloody nose; down with your bag of books;
and now, my game chick,&rdquo; whispered he to me, placing
himself between me and my adversary, so that he could not observe
his motions; &ldquo;clench your fist in this manner, and hold
your arms in this, and when he strikes at you, move them as I now
show you, and he can&rsquo;t hurt you; now, don&rsquo;t be
afraid, but go at him.&rdquo;&nbsp; I confess that I was somewhat
afraid, but I considered myself in some degree under the
protection of the famous Sergeant, and, clenching my fist, I went
at my foe, using the guard which my ally recommended.&nbsp; The
result corresponded to a certain degree with the predictions of
the Sergeant; I gave my foe a bloody nose and a black eye,
though, notwithstanding my recent lesson in the art of
self-defence, he contrived to give me two or three clumsy
blows.&nbsp; From that moment I was the especial favourite of the
Sergeant, who gave me farther lessons, so that in a little time I
became a very fair boxer, beating everybody of my own size who
attacked me.&nbsp; The old gentleman, however, made me promise
never to be quarrelsome, nor to turn his instructions to account,
except in self-defence.&nbsp; I have always borne in mind my
promise, and have made it a point of conscience never to fight
unless absolutely <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>compelled.&nbsp; Folks may rail
against boxing if they please, but being able to box may
sometimes stand a quiet man in good stead.&nbsp; How should I
have fared to-day, but for the instructions of Sergeant
Broughton?&nbsp; But for them, the brutal ruffian who insulted me
must have passed unpunished.&nbsp; He will not soon forget the
lesson which I have just given him&mdash;the only lesson he could
understand.&nbsp; What would have been the use of reasoning with
a fellow of that description?&nbsp; Brave old Broughton!&nbsp; I
owe him much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And your manner of fighting,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;was
the manner employed by Sergeant Broughton?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said my new acquaintance; &lsquo;it was the
manner in which he beat every one who attempted to contend with
him, till, in an evil hour, he entered the ring with Slack, <a
name="citation162a"></a><a href="#footnote162a"
class="citation">[162a]</a> without any training or preparation,
and by a chance blow lost the battle to a man who had been beaten
with ease by those who, in the hands of Broughton, appeared like
so many children.&nbsp; It was the way of fighting of him who
first taught Englishmen to box scientifically, who was the head
and father of the fighters of what is now called the old school,
the last of which were Johnson and Big Ben.&rsquo; <a
name="citation162b"></a><a href="#footnote162b"
class="citation">[162b]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;A wonderful man that Big Ben,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was so,&rsquo; said the elderly individual;
&lsquo;but had it not been for Broughton, I question whether Ben
would have ever been the fighter he was.&nbsp; Oh! there is no
one like old Broughton; but for him I should at the present
moment be sneaking along the road, pursued by the hissings and
hootings of the dirty flatterers of that black-guard
coachman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you mean,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;by those words
of yours, that the coachmen would speedily disappear from the
roads?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that a new method of
travelling is about to be established, which will supersede the
old.&nbsp; I am a poor engraver, as my father was before me; but
engraving is an intellectual trade, and by following it, I have
been brought in contact with some of the cleverest men in
England.&nbsp; It has even made me acquainted with the projector
of the scheme, which he has told me many <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>of the
wisest heads of England have been dreaming of during a period of
six hundred years, and which it seems was alluded to by a certain
Brazen Head in the story-book of Friar Bacon, who is generally
supposed to have been a wizard, but in reality was a great
philosopher.&nbsp; Young man, in less than twenty years, by which
time I shall be dead and gone, England will be surrounded with
roads of metal, on which armies may travel with mighty velocity,
and of which the walls of brass and iron by which the friar
proposed to defend his native land are types.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
then, shaking me by the hand, proceeded on his way, whilst I
returned to the inn.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>FRANCIS ARDRY&mdash;HIS MISFORTUNES&mdash;DOG AND LION
FIGHT&mdash;GREAT MEN OF THE WORLD</p>
<p>A few days after the circumstance which I have last
commemorated, it chanced that, as I was standing at the door of
the inn, one of the numerous stage-coaches which were in the
habit of stopping there, drove up, and several passengers got
down.&nbsp; I had assisted a woman with a couple of children to
dismount, and had just delivered to her a band-box, which
appeared to be her only property, which she had begged me to
fetch down from the roof, when I felt a hand laid upon my
shoulder, and heard a voice exclaim, &lsquo;Is it possible, old
fellow, that I find you in this place?&rsquo;&nbsp; I turned
round, and wrapped in a large blue cloak, I beheld my good friend
Francis Ardry. <a name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a>&nbsp; I shook him most warmly by the
hand, and said, &lsquo;If you are surprised to see me, I am no
less so to see you, where are you bound to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am bound for L---, <a name="citation163b"></a><a
href="#footnote163b" class="citation">[163b]</a> at any rate I am
booked for that seaport,&rsquo; said my friend in reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for it,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for in that
case we shall have to part in a quarter of an hour, the coach by
which you came stopping no longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And whither are you bound?&rsquo; demanded my
friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am stopping at present in this house, quite
undetermined as to what to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&lsquo;Then come along with me,&rsquo; said Francis
Ardry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That I can scarcely do,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have a
horse in the stall which I cannot afford to ruin by racing to
L--- by the side of your coach.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My friend mused for a moment: &lsquo;I have no particular
business at L---,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I was merely going
thither to pass a day or two, till an affair, in which I am
deeply interested, at C--- <a name="citation164"></a><a
href="#footnote164" class="citation">[164]</a> shall come
off.&nbsp; I think I shall stay with you for four-and-twenty
hours at least; I have been rather melancholy of late, and cannot
afford to part with a friend like you at the present moment; it
is an unexpected piece of good fortune to have met you; and I
have not been very fortunate of late,&rsquo; he added,
sighing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am glad to see you once
more, whether fortunate or not; where is your baggage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yon trunk is mine,&rsquo; said Francis, pointing to a
trunk of black Russian leather upon the coach.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will soon have it down,&rsquo; said I, and at a word
which I gave to one of the hangers-on at the inn, the trunk was
taken from the top of the coach.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said I
to Francis Ardry, &lsquo;follow me, I am a person of some
authority in this house;&rsquo; thereupon I led Francis Ardry
into the house, and a word which I said to a waiter forthwith
installed Francis Ardry in a comfortable private sitting-room,
and his trunk in the very best sleeping-room of our extensive
establishment.</p>
<p>It was now about one o&rsquo;clock: Francis Ardry ordered
dinner for two, to be ready at four, and a pint of sherry to be
brought forthwith, which I requested my friend the waiter might
be the very best, and which in effect turned out as I requested;
we sat down, and when we had drank to each other&rsquo;s health,
Frank requested me to make known to him how I had contrived to
free myself from my embarrassments in London, what I had been
about since I quitted that city, and the present posture of my
affairs.</p>
<p>I related to Francis Ardry how I had composed the Life of
Joseph Sell, and how the sale of it to the bookseller had enabled
me to quit London with money in my pocket, which had supported me
during a long course of ramble in the country, into the
particulars of which I, however, did not enter with any
considerable degree of fulness.&nbsp; I summed up my account by
saying that &lsquo;I was at present a kind of overlooker in the
stables of the inn, <!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>had still some pounds in my purse,
and, moreover, a capital horse in the stall.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No very agreeable posture of affairs,&rsquo; said
Francis Ardry, looking rather seriously at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I make no complaints,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;my
prospects are not very bright, it is true, but sometimes I have
visions, both waking and sleeping, which, though always strange,
are invariably agreeable.&nbsp; Last night, in my chamber near
the hayloft, I dreamt that I had passed over an almost
interminable wilderness&mdash;an enormous wall rose before me,
the wall, methought, was the great wall of China:&mdash;strange
figures appeared to be beckoning to me from the top of the wall;
such visions are not exactly to be sneered at.&nbsp; Not that
such phantasmagoria,&rsquo; said I, raising my voice, &lsquo;are
to be compared for a moment with such desirable things as
fashion, fine clothes, cheques from uncles, parliamentary
interest, the love of splendid females.&nbsp; Ah! woman&rsquo;s
love,&rsquo; said I, and sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the fellow?&rsquo; said
Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing like it,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Love, divine love,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confound love,&rsquo; said Francis Ardry, &lsquo;I hate
the very name; I have made myself a pretty fool by it, but trust
me for ever being caught at such folly again.&nbsp; In an evil
hour I abandoned my former pursuits and amusements for it; in one
morning spent at Joey&rsquo;s there was more real pleasure than
in&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you are not hankering
after dog-fighting again, a sport which none but the gross and
unrefined care anything for?&nbsp; No, one&rsquo;s thoughts
should be occupied by something higher and more rational than
dog-fighting; and what better than love&mdash;divine love?&nbsp;
Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing like it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rsquo; said Francis
Ardry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;why I was repeating, to
the best of my recollection, what I heard you say on a former
occasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If ever I talked such stuff,&rsquo; said Francis Ardry,
&lsquo;I was a fool; and indeed I cannot deny that I have been
one: no, there is no denying that I have been a fool.&nbsp; What
do you think?&nbsp; That false Annette <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a> has cruelly abandoned me.&rsquo;</p>

166</span>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;perhaps you have
yourself to thank for her having done so; did you never treat her
with coldness, and repay her marks of affectionate interest with
strange fits of eccentric humour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord! how little you know of women,&rsquo; said Francis
Ardry; &lsquo;had I done as you suppose, I should probably have
possessed her at the present moment.&nbsp; I treated her in a
manner diametrically opposite to that.&nbsp; I loaded her with
presents, was always most assiduous to her, always at her feet,
as I may say, yet she nevertheless abandoned me&mdash;and for
whom?&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to say&mdash;for a
fiddler.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I took a glass of wine, Francis Ardry followed my example, and
then proceeded to detail to me the treatment which he had
experienced from Annette, and from what he said, it appeared that
her conduct to him had been in the highest degree reprehensible;
notwithstanding he had indulged her in everything, she was never
civil to him, but loaded him continually with taunts and insults,
and had finally, on his being unable to supply her with a sum of
money which she had demanded, decamped from the lodgings which he
had taken for her, carrying with her all the presents which at
various times he had bestowed upon her, and had put herself under
the protection of a gentleman who played the bassoon at the
Italian Opera, at which place it appeared that her sister had
lately been engaged as a danseuse.&nbsp; My friend informed me
that at first he had experienced great agony at the ingratitude
of Annette, but at last had made up his mind to forget her, and
in order more effectually to do so, had left London with the
intention of witnessing a fight, which was shortly coming off at
a town in these parts, between some dogs and a lion; <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a> which combat, he informed me, had for
some time past been looked forward to with intense eagerness by
the gentlemen of the sporting world.</p>
<p>I commended him for his resolution, at the same time advising
him not to give up his mind entirely to dog-fighting, as he had
formerly done, but, when the present combat should be over, to
return to his rhetorical studies, and above all to marry some
rich and handsome lady on the first opportunity, as, with his
person and expectations, he had only to sue for the hand of <!--
page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>the daughter of a marquis to be successful, telling
him, with a sigh, that all women were not Annettes, and that upon
the whole there was nothing like them.&nbsp; To which advice he
answered, that he intended to return to rhetoric as soon as the
lion fight should be over, but that he never intended to marry,
having had enough of women; adding, that he was glad he had no
sister, as, with the feelings which he entertained with respect
to her sex, he should be unable to treat her with common
affection, and concluded by repeating a proverb which he had
learnt from an Arab whom he had met at Venice, to the effect
that, &lsquo;one who has been stung by a snake, shivers at the
sight of a string.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a little more conversation, we strolled to the stable,
where my horse was standing; my friend, who was a connoisseur in
horse-flesh, surveyed the animal with attention, and after
inquiring where and how I had obtained him, asked what I intended
to do with him; on my telling him that I was undetermined, and
that I was afraid the horse was likely to prove a burden to me,
he said, &lsquo;It is a noble animal, and if you mind what you
are about, you may make a small fortune by him.&nbsp; I do not
want such an animal myself, nor do I know any one who does; but a
great horse-fair will be held shortly at a place where, it is
true, I have never been, but of which I have heard a great deal
from my acquaintances, where it is said a first-rate horse is
always sure to fetch its value; that place is Horncastle, in
Lincolnshire; you should take him thither.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Francis Ardry and myself dined together, and after dinner
partook of a bottle of the best port which the inn
afforded.&nbsp; After a few glasses, we had a great deal of
conversation; I again brought the subject of marriage and love,
divine love, upon the carpet, but Francis almost immediately
begged me to drop it; and on my having the delicacy to comply, he
reverted to dog-fighting, on which he talked well and learnedly;
amongst other things, he said that it was a princely sport of
great antiquity, and quoted from Quintus Curtius to prove that
the princes of India must have been of the fancy, they having,
according to that author, treated Alexander to a fight between
certain dogs and a lion.&nbsp; Becoming, notwithstanding my
friend&rsquo;s eloquence and learning, somewhat tired of the
subject, I began to talk about Alexander.&nbsp; Francis Ardry
<!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>said he was one of the two great men whom the world has
produced, the other being Napoleon; I replied that I believed
Tamerlane was a greater man than either; but Francis Ardry knew
nothing of Tamerlane, save what he had gathered from the play of
Timour the Tartar.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;Alexander and Napoleon are the great men of the world,
their names are known everywhere.&nbsp; Alexander has been dead
upwards of two thousand years, but the very English bumpkins
sometimes christen their boys by the name of Alexander&mdash;can
there be a greater evidence of his greatness?&nbsp; As for
Napoleon, there are some parts of India in which his bust is
worshipped.&rsquo;&nbsp; Wishing to make up a triumvirate I
mentioned the name of Wellington, to which Francis Ardry merely
said, &lsquo;bah!&rsquo; and resumed the subject of
dog-fighting.</p>
<p>Francis Ardry remained at the inn during that day and the
next, and then departed to the dog and lion fight; I never saw
him afterwards, and merely heard of him once after the lapse of
some years, and what I then heard was not exactly what I could
have wished to hear.&nbsp; He did not make much of the advantages
which he possessed, a pity, for how great were those
advantages&mdash;person, intellect, eloquence, connection,
riches! yet, with all these advantages, one thing highly needful
seems to have been wanting in Francis.&nbsp; A desire, a craving,
to perform something great and good.&nbsp; Oh! what a vast deal
may be done with intellect, courage, riches, accompanied by the
desire of doing something great and good!&nbsp; Why, a person may
carry the blessings of civilization and religion to barbarous,
yet at the same time to beautiful and romantic lands; and what a
triumph there is for him who does so!&nbsp; What a crown of
glory! of far greater value that those surrounding the brows of
your mere conquerors.&nbsp; Yet who has done so in these
times?&nbsp; Not many; not three, not two, something seems to
have been always wanting: there is, however, one instance in
which the various requisites have been united, and the crown, the
most desirable in the world&mdash;at least which I consider to be
the most desirable&mdash;achieved, and only one, that of Brooke
of Borneo. <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"

<p>MR. PLATITUDE AND THE MAN IN BLACK&mdash;THE
POSTILLION&rsquo;S ADVENTURES&mdash;THE LONE HOUSE&mdash;A GOODLY
ASSEMBLAGE</p>
<p>It never rains, but it pours.&nbsp; I was destined to see at
this inn more acquaintances than one.&nbsp; On the day of Francis
Ardry&rsquo;s departure, shortly after he had taken leave of me,
as I was standing in the corn-chamber at a kind of writing-table
or desk, fastened to the wall, with a book before me, in which I
was making out an account of the corn and hay lately received and
distributed, my friend the postillion came running in out of
breath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here they both are,&rsquo; he gasped out;
&lsquo;pray do come and look at them!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom do you mean?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, that red-haired Jack Priest, and that idiotic
parson, Platitude; they have just been set down by one of the
coaches, and want a post-chaise to go across the country in; and
what do you think?&nbsp; I am to have the driving of them.&nbsp;
I have no time to lose, for I must get myself ready: so do come
and look at them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I hastened into the yard of the inn; two or three of the
helpers of our establishment were employed in drawing forward a
post-chaise out of the chaise-house, which occupied one side of
the yard, and which was spacious enough to contain nearly twenty
of these vehicles, though it was never full, several of them
being always out upon the roads, as the demand upon us for
post-chaises across the country was very great.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There they are,&rsquo; said the postillion, softly,
nodding towards two individuals, in one of whom I recognised the
man in black, and in the other Mr. Platitude; &lsquo;there they
are; have a good look at them, while I go and get
ready.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man in black and Mr. Platitude were
walking up and down the yard, Mr. Platitude was doing his best to
make himself appear ridiculous, talking very loudly in
exceedingly bad Italian, evidently for the purpose of attracting
the notice of the bystanders, in which he succeeded, all the
stable-boys and hangers on about the yard, attracted by his
vociferation, grinning at his ridiculous figure as he limped up
and down.&nbsp; The man in black said little or nothing, but from
the glances which he cast sideways appeared to be thoroughly
ashamed of his companion; the worthy couple presently arrived
close to where I was standing, and the <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>man in
black, who was nearest to me, perceiving me, stood still as if
hesitating, but recovering himself in a moment, he moved on
without taking any further notice; Mr. Platitude exclaimed as
they passed, in broken lingo, &lsquo;I hope we shall find the
holy doctors all assembled,&rsquo; and as they returned, &lsquo;I
make no doubt that they will all be rejoiced to see
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to be standing an idle gazer, I went
to the chaise and assisted in attaching the horses, which had now
been brought out, to the pole.&nbsp; The postillion presently
arrived, and finding all ready took the reins and mounted the
box, whilst I very politely opened the door for the two
travellers; Mr. Platitude got in first, and, without taking any
notice of me, seated himself on the farther side.&nbsp; In got
the man in black and seated himself nearest to me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All is right,&rsquo; said I, as I shut the door, whereupon
the postillion cracked his whip, and the chaise drove out of the
yard.&nbsp; Just as I shut the door, however, and just as Mr.
Platitude had recommenced talking in jergo, at the top of his
voice, the man in black turned his face partly towards me, and
gave me a wink with his left eye.</p>
<p>I did not see my friend the postillion till the next morning,
when he gave me an account of the adventures he had met with on
his expedition.&nbsp; It appeared that he had driven the man in
black and the Reverend Platitude across the country by roads and
lanes which he had some difficulty in threading.&nbsp; At length,
when he had reached a part of the country where he had never been
before, the man in black pointed out to him a house near the
corner of a wood, to which he informed him they were bound.&nbsp;
The postillion said it was a strange-looking house, with a wall
round it; and, upon the whole, bore something of the look of a
madhouse.&nbsp; There was already a post-chaise at the gate, from
which three individuals had alighted&mdash;one of them the
postillion said was a mean-looking scoundrel, with a regular
petty-larceny expression in his countenance.&nbsp; He was dressed
very much like the man in black, and the postillion said that he
could almost have taken his bible oath that they were both of the
same profession.&nbsp; The other two he said were parsons, he
could swear that, though he had never seen them before; there
could be no mistake about them.&nbsp; Church of England parsons
the postillion swore they were, with their black coats, white
cravats, and airs, in which clumsiness <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>and conceit
were most funnily blended&mdash;Church of England parsons of the
Platitude description, who had been in Italy, and seen the Pope,
and kissed his toe, and picked up a little broken Italian, and
come home greater fools than they went forth.&nbsp; It appeared
that they were all acquaintances of Mr. Platitude, for when the
postillion had alighted and let Mr. Platitude and his companion
out of the chaise, Mr. Platitude shook the whole three by the
hand, conversed with his two brothers in a little broken jergo,
and addressed the petty-larceny looking individual by the title
of Reverend Doctor.&nbsp; In the midst of these greetings,
however, the postillion said the man in black came up to him, and
proceeded to settle with him for the chaise; he had shaken hands
with nobody, and had merely nodded to the others; &lsquo;and
now,&rsquo; said the postillion, &lsquo;he evidently wished to
get rid of me, fearing, probably, that I should see too much of
the nonsense that was going on.&nbsp; It was whilst settling with
me that he seemed to recognise me for the first time, for he
stared hard at me, and at last asked whether I had not been in
Italy; to which question, with a nod and a laugh, I replied that
I had.&nbsp; I was then going to ask him about the health of the
image of Holy Mary, and to say that I hoped it had recovered from
its horsewhipping; but he interrupted me, paid me the money for
the fare, and gave me a crown for myself, saying he would not
detain me any longer.&nbsp; I say, partner, I am a poor
postillion, but when he gave me the crown I had a good mind to
fling it in his face.&nbsp; I reflected, however, that it was not
mere gift-money, but coin which I had earned, and hardly too, so
I put it in my pocket, and I bethought me, moreover, that, knave
as I knew him to be, he had always treated me with civility; so I
nodded to him, and he said something which, perhaps, he meant for
Latin, but which sounded very much like &ldquo;vails,&rdquo; and
by which he doubtless alluded to the money which he had given
me.&nbsp; He then went into the house with the rest, the coach
drove away which had brought the others, and I was about to get
on the box and follow; observing, however, two more chaises
driving up, I thought I would be in no hurry, so I just led my
horses and chaise a little out of the way, and pretending to be
occupied about the harness, I kept a tolerably sharp look-out at
the new arrivals.&nbsp; Well, partner, the next vehicle that
drove up was a gentleman&rsquo;s <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>carriage
which I knew very well, as well as those with it, who were a
father and son, the father a good kind of old gentleman, and a
justice of the peace, therefore not very wise, as you may
suppose; the son a puppy who has been abroad, where he contrived
to forget his own language, though only nine months absent, and
now rules the roast over his father and mother, whose only child
he is, and by whom he is thought wondrous clever.&nbsp; So this
foreigneering chap brings his poor old father to this out of the
way house to meet these Platitudes and petty larceny villains,
and perhaps would have brought his mother too, only, simple
thing, by good fortune she happens to be laid up with the
rheumatiz.&nbsp; Well, the father and son, I beg pardon I mean
the son and father, got down and went in, and then after their
carriage was gone, the chaise behind drove up, in which was a
huge fat fellow, weighing twenty stone at least, but with
something of a foreign look, and with him&mdash;who do you
think?&nbsp; Why, a rascally Unitarian minister&mdash;that is, a
fellow who had been such a minister&mdash;but who some years ago
leaving his own people, who had bred him up and sent him to their
college at York, went over to the High Church, and is now, I
suppose, going over to some other church, for he was talking, as
he got down, wondrous fast in Latin, or what sounded something
like Latin, to the fat fellow, who appeared to take things
wonderfully easy, and merely grunted to the dog Latin which the
scoundrel had learnt at the expense of the poor Unitarians at
York.&nbsp; So they went into the house, and presently arrived
another chaise, but ere I could make any farther observations,
the porter of the out-of-the-way house came up to me, asking what
I was stopping there for? bidding me go away, and not pry into
other people&rsquo;s business.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty
business,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;that is being transacted
in a play like this,&rdquo; and then I was going to say something
uncivil, but he went to attend to the new comers, and I took
myself away on my own business as he bade me, not however, before
observing that these two last were a couple of
blackcoats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The postillion then proceeded to relate how he made the best
of his way to a small public-house, about a mile off, where he
had intended to bait, and how he met on the way a landau and
pair, belonging to a Scotch coxcomb whom he had known in London,
about whom he related <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>some curious particulars, and then
continued: &lsquo;Well, after I had passed him and his turn-out,
I drove straight to the public-house, where I baited my horses,
and where I found some of the chaises and drivers who had driven
the folks to the lunatic-looking mansion, and were now waiting to
take them up again.&nbsp; Whilst my horses were eating their
bait, I sat me down, as the weather was warm, at a table outside,
and smoked a pipe and drank some ale, in company with the
coachman of the old gentleman who had gone to the house with his
son, and the coachman then told me that the house was a Papist
house, and that the present was a grand meeting of all the fools
and rascals in the country, who came to bow down to images, and
to concert schemes&mdash;pretty schemes, no doubt&mdash;for
overturning the religion of the country, and that for his part he
did not approve of being concerned with such doings, and that he
was going to give his master warning next day.&nbsp; So, as we
were drinking and discoursing, up drove the chariot of the
Scotchman, and down got his valet and the driver, and whilst the
driver was seeing after the horses, the valet came and sat down
at the table where the gentleman&rsquo;s coachman and I were
drinking.&nbsp; I knew the fellow well, a Scotchman like his
master, and just of the same kidney, with white kid gloves, red
hair frizzled, a patch of paint on his face, and his hands
covered with rings.&nbsp; This very fellow, I must tell you, was
one of those most busy in endeavouring to get me turned out of
the servants&rsquo; club in Park Lane, because I happened to
serve a literary man; so he sat down, and in a kind of affected
tone cried out, &ldquo;Landlord, bring me a glass of cold
negus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord, however, told him that there
was no negus, but that if he pleased he could have a jug of as
good beer as any in the country.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound the
beer,&rdquo; said the valet, &ldquo;do you think I am accustomed
to such vulgar beverage?&rdquo;&nbsp; However, as he found there
was nothing better to be had, he let the man bring him some beer,
and when he had got it, soon showed that he could drink it easily
enough; so, when he had drank two or three draughts, he turned
his eyes in a contemptuous manner, first on the coachman and then
on me; I saw the scamp recollected me, for after staring at me
and at my dress for about half a minute, he put on a broad grin,
and flinging his head back he uttered a loud laugh.&nbsp; Well, I
did not like this, as you <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>may well
believe, and taking the pipe out of my mouth, I asked him if he
meant anything personal, to which he answered that he had said
nothing to me, and that he had a right to look where he pleased,
and laugh when he pleased.&nbsp; Well, as to a certain extent he
was right as to looking and laughing, and as I have occasionally
looked at a fool and laughed, though I was not the fool in this
instance, I put my pipe into my mouth and said no more.&nbsp;
This quiet and well-regulated behaviour of mine, however, the
fellow interpreted into fear; so, after drinking a little more,
he suddenly started up, and striding once or twice before the
table, he asked me what I meant by that impertinent question of
mine, saying that he had a good mind to wring my nose for my
presumption.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have?&rdquo; said I, getting up and
laying down my pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll now give you
an opportunity.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I put myself in an attitude, and
went up to him, saying, &ldquo;I have an old score to settle with
you, you scamp; you wanted to get me turned out of the club,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon, remembering that he
had threatened to wring my nose, I gave him a snorter upon his
own.&nbsp; I wish you could have seen the fellow when he felt the
smart; so far from trying to defend himself, he turned round, and
with his hand to his face, attempted to run away, but I was now
in a regular passion, and following him up, got before him, and
was going to pummel away at him when he burst into tears, and
begged me not to hurt him, saying that he was sorry if he had
offended me, and that, if I pleased, he would go down on his
knees, or do anything else I wanted.&nbsp; Well, when I heard him
talk in this manner, I, of course, let him be; I could hardly
help laughing at the figure he cut, his face all blubbered with
tears and blood and paint; but I did not laugh at the poor
creature either, but went to the table and took up my pipe and
smoked and drank as if nothing had happened; and the fellow,
after having been to the pump, came and sat down, crying and
trying to curry favour with me and the coachman; presently,
however, putting on a confidential look, he began to talk of the
Popish house, and of the doings there, and said he supposed as
how we were of the party, and that it was all right; and then he
began to talk of the Pope of Rome, and what a nice man he was,
and what a fine thing it was to be of his religion, especially if
folks went over to him; and how it advanced them in the <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>world, and gave them consideration; and how his master,
who had been abroad and seen the Pope, and kissed his toe, was
going over to the Popish religion, and had persuaded him to
consent to do so, and to forsake his own, which I think the
scoundrel called the &rsquo;Piscopal Church of Scotland, and how
many others of that Church were going over, thinking to better
their condition in life by so doing, and to be more thought on;
and how many of the English Church were thinking of going over
too&mdash;and that he had no doubt that it would all end right
and comfortably.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, as he was going on in this
way, the old coachman began to spit, and getting up, flung all
the beer that was in his jug upon the ground, and going away,
ordered another jug of beer, and sat down at another table,
saying that he would not drink in such company; and I, too, got
up, and flung what beer remained in my jug&mdash;there
wasn&rsquo;t more than a drop&mdash;in the fellow&rsquo;s face,
saying I would scorn to drink any more in such company; and then
I went to my horses, put them to, paid my reckoning, and drove
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The postillion having related his story, to which I listened
with all due attention, mused for a moment, and then said:
&lsquo;I dare say you remember how, some time since, when old
Bill had been telling us how the Government a long time ago had
done away with robbing on the highway by putting down the
public-houses and places which the highwaymen frequented, and by
sending out a good mounted police to hunt them down, I said that
it was a shame that the present Government did not employ
somewhat the same means in order to stop the proceedings of Mumbo
Jumbo and his gang now-a-days in England.&nbsp; Howsomever, since
I have driven a fare to a Popish rendezvous, and seen something
of what is going on there, I should conceive that the Government
are justified in allowing the gang the free exercise of their
calling.&nbsp; Anybody is welcome to stoop and pick up nothing or
worse than nothing, and if Mumbo Jumbo&rsquo;s people, after
their expeditions, return to their haunts with no better plunder
in the shape of converts than what I saw going into yonder place
of call, I should say they are welcome to what they get; for if
that&rsquo;s the kind of rubbish they steal out of the Church of
England, or any other Church, who in his senses but would say a
good riddance, and many thanks for your trouble; at any rate,
that is my opinion of the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>DELIBERATIONS WITH SELF&mdash;RESOLUTION&mdash;INVITATION TO
DINNER&mdash;THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER&mdash;THE LANDLORD&rsquo;S
OFFER&mdash;THE COMET WINE</p>
<p>It was now that I had frequent deliberations with
myself.&nbsp; Should I continue at the inn in my present
position?&nbsp; I was not very much captivated with it; there was
little poetry in keeping an account of the corn, hay, and straw
which came in, and was given out, and I was fond of poetry;
moreover, there was no glory at all to be expected in doing so,
and I was fond of glory.&nbsp; Should I give up that situation,
and remaining at the inn, become ostler under old Bill?&nbsp;
There was more poetry in rubbing down horses than in keeping an
account of straw, hay, and corn; there was also some prospect of
glory attached to the situation of ostler, for the grooms and
stable-boys occasionally talked of an ostler, a great way down
the road, who had been presented by some sporting people, not
with a silver vase, as our governor had been, but with a silver
currycomb, in testimony of their admiration for his skill; but I
confess that the poetry of rubbing down had become, as all other
poetry becomes, rather prosy by frequent repetition, and with
respect to the chance of deriving glory from the employment, I
entertained in the event of my determining to stay, very slight
hope of ever attaining skill in the ostler art sufficient to
induce sporting people to bestow upon me a silver
currycomb.&nbsp; I was not half so good an ostler as old Bill,
who had never been presented with a silver currycomb, and I never
expected to become so, therefore what chance had I?&nbsp; It was
true, there was a prospect of some pecuniary emolument to be
derived by remaining in either situation.&nbsp; It was very
probable that, provided I continued to keep an account of the hay
and corn coming in and expended, the landlord would consent to
allow me a pound a week, which at the end of a dozen years,
provided I kept myself sober, would amount to a considerable
sum.&nbsp; I might, on the retirement of old Bill, by taking his
place, save up a decent sum of money, provided, unlike him, I
kept myself sober, and laid by all the shillings and sixpences I
<!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>got; but the prospect of laying up a decent sum of
money was not of sufficient importance to induce me to continue
either at my wooden desk, or in the inn-yard.&nbsp; The reader
will remember what difficulty I had to make up my mind to become
a merchant under the Armenian&rsquo;s auspices, even with the
prospect of making two or three hundred thousand pounds by
following the Armenian way of doing business, so it was not
probable that I should feel disposed to be book-keeper or ostler
all my life with no other prospect than being able to make a tidy
sum of money.&nbsp; If, indeed, besides the prospect of making a
tidy-sum at the end of perhaps forty years ostlering, I had been
certain of being presented with a silver currycomb with my name
engraved upon it, which I might have left to my descendants, or,
in default thereof, to the parish church destined to contain my
bones, with directions that it might be soldered into the wall
above the arch leading from the body of the church into the
chancel&mdash;I will not say that with such a certainty of
immortality, combined with such a prospect of moderate pecuniary
advantage, I might not have thought it worth my while to stay,
but I entertained no such certainty, and taking everything into
consideration, I determined to mount my horse and leave the
inn.</p>
<p>This horse had caused me for some time past no little
perplexity; I had frequently repented of having purchased him,
more especially as the purchase had been made with another
person&rsquo;s money, and had more than once shown him to people
who, I imagined, were likely to purchase him; but, though they
were profuse in his praise, as people generally are in the praise
of what they don&rsquo;t intend to purchase, they never made me
an offer, and now that I had determined to mount on his back and
ride away, what was I to do with him in the sequel?&nbsp; I could
not maintain him long.&nbsp; Suddenly I bethought me of
Horncastle, which Francis Ardry had mentioned as a place where
the horse was likely to find a purchaser, and not having
determined upon any particular place to which to repair, I
thought that I could do no better than betake myself to
Horncastle in the first instance, and there endeavour to dispose
of my horse.</p>
<p>On making inquiries with respect to the situation of
Horncastle, and the time when the fair would be held, I learned
that the town was situated in Lincolnshire, about a hundred and
fifty miles from the inn at which I was at <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>present
sojourning, and that the fair would be held nominally within
about a month, but that it was always requisite to be on the spot
some days before the nominal day of the fair, as all the best
horses were generally sold before that time, and the people who
came to purchase gone away with what they had bought.</p>
<p>The people of the inn were very sorry on being informed of my
determination to depart.&nbsp; Old Bill told me that he had hoped
as how I had intended to settle down there, and to take his place
as ostler when he was fit for no more work, adding, that though I
did not know much of the business, yet he had no doubt but that I
might improve.&nbsp; My friend the postillion was particularly
sorry, and taking me with him to the tap-room called for two
pints of beer, to one of which he treated me; and whilst we were
drinking told me how particularly sorry he was at the thought of
my going, but that he hoped I should think better of the
matter.&nbsp; On my telling him that I must go, he said that he
trusted I should put off my departure for three weeks, in order
that I might be present at his marriage, the banns of which were
just about to be published.&nbsp; He said that nothing would give
him greater pleasure than to see me dance a minuet with his wife
after the marriage dinner; but I told him it was impossible that
I should stay, my affairs imperatively calling me elsewhere; and
that with respect to my dancing a minuet, such a thing was out of
the question, as I had never learned to dance.&nbsp; At which he
said that he was exceedingly sorry, and finding me determined to
go, wished me success in all my undertakings.</p>
<p>The master of the house, to whom, as in duty bound, I
communicated my intention before I spoke of it to the servants,
was, I make no doubt, very sorry, though he did not exactly tell
me so.&nbsp; What he said was, that he had never expected that I
should remain long there, as such a situation never appeared to
him quite suitable to me, though I had been very diligent, and
had given him perfect satisfaction.&nbsp; On his inquiring when I
intended to depart, I informed him next day, whereupon he begged
that I would defer my departure till the next day but one, and do
him the favour of dining with him on the morrow.&nbsp; I informed
him that I should be only too happy.</p>
<p>On the following day at four o&rsquo;clock I dined with the
landlord, in company with a commercial traveller.&nbsp; The <!--
page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>dinner was good, though plain, consisting of boiled
mackerel&mdash;rather a rarity in those parts at that
time&mdash;with fennel sauce, a prime baron of roast beef after
the mackerel, then a tart and noble Cheshire cheese; we had prime
sherry at dinner, and whilst eating the cheese prime porter, that
of Barclay, the only good porter in the world.&nbsp; After the
cloth was removed we had a bottle of very good port; and whilst
partaking of the port I had an argument with the commercial
traveller on the subject of the corn-laws.</p>
<p>The commercial traveller, having worsted me in the argument on
the subject of the corn-laws, got up in great glee, saying that
he must order his gig, as business must be attended to.&nbsp;
Before leaving the room, however, he shook me patronizingly by
the hand, and said something to the master of the house, but in
so low a tone that it escaped my ear.</p>
<p>No sooner had he departed than the master of the house told me
that his friend the traveller had just said that I was a
confounded sensible young fellow, and not at all opinionated, a
sentiment in which he himself perfectly agreed&mdash;then hemming
once or twice, he said that as I was going on a journey he hoped
I was tolerably well provided with money, adding that travelling
was rather expensive, especially on horseback, the manner in
which he supposed, as I had a horse in the stable, I intended to
travel.&nbsp; I told him that though I was not particularly well
supplied with money, I had sufficient for the expenses of my
journey, at the end of which I hoped to procure more.&nbsp; He
then hemmed again, and said that since I had been at the inn I
had rendered him a great deal of service in more ways than one,
and that he could not think of permitting me to depart without
making me some remuneration; then putting his hand into his
waistcoat pocket he handed me a cheque for ten pounds, which he
had prepared beforehand, the value of which he said I could
receive at the next town, or that, if I wished it, any waiter in
the house would cash it for me.&nbsp; I thanked him for his
generosity in the best terms I could select, but, handing him
back his cheque, I told him that I could not accept it, saying
that, so far from his being my debtor, I believed myself to be
indebted to him, as not only myself but my horse had been living
at his house for several weeks.&nbsp; He replied that, as for my
board at a house like <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>his, it amounted to nothing, and as
for the little corn and hay which the horse had consumed it was
of no consequence, and that he must insist upon my taking the
cheque.&nbsp; But I again declined, telling him that doing so
would be a violation of a rule which I had determined to follow,
and which nothing but the greatest necessity would ever compel me
to break through&mdash;never to incur obligations.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;receiving this money will not
be incurring an obligation: it is your due.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
do not think so,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I did not engage to serve
you for money, nor will I take any from you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Perhaps you will take it as a loan?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I never borrow.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the landlord, smiling, &lsquo;you are
different from all others that I am acquainted with.&nbsp; I
never yet knew any one else who scrupled to borrow and receive
obligations.&nbsp; Why, there are two baronets in this
neighbourhood who have borrowed money of me, ay, and who have
never repaid what they borrowed; and there are a dozen squires
who are under considerable obligations to me, who I dare say will
never return them.&nbsp; Come, you need not be more scrupulous
than your superiors&mdash;I mean in station.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Every vessel must stand on its own bottom,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;they take pleasure in receiving obligations, I take
pleasure in being independent.&nbsp; Perhaps they are wise, and I
am a fool, I know not, but one thing I am certain of, which is,
that were I not independent I should be very unhappy: I should
have no visions then.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you any
relations?&rsquo; said the landlord, looking at me
compassionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;Excuse me, but I don&rsquo;t think
you are exactly fit to take care of yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;There you are mistaken,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I can take
precious good care of myself; ay, and can drive a precious hard
bargain when I have occasion, but driving bargains is a widely
different thing from receiving gifts.&nbsp; I am going to take my
horse to Horncastle, and when there I shall endeavour to obtain
his full value&mdash;ay, to the last penny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Horncastle!&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;I have
heard of that place; you mustn&rsquo;t be dreaming visions when
you get there, or they&rsquo;ll steal the horse from under
you.&nbsp; Well,&rsquo; said he, rising, &lsquo;I shall not press
you farther on the subject of the cheque.&nbsp; I intend,
however, to put you under an obligation to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
then rang the bell, and having ordered two fresh glasses to be
brought, he went out and presently returned with a small pint
bottle, which <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>he uncorked with his own hand; then
sitting down, he said: &lsquo;The wine that I bring here, is port
of eighteen hundred and eleven, the year of the comet, the best
vintage on record; the wine which we have been drinking,&rsquo;
he added, &lsquo;is good, but not to be compared with this, which
I never sell, and which I am chary of.&nbsp; When you have drank
some of it, I think you will own that I have conferred an
obligation upon you;&rsquo; he then filled the glasses, the wine
which he poured out diffusing an aroma through the room; then
motioning me to drink, he raised his own glass to his lips,
saying: &lsquo;Come, friend, I drink to your success at
Horncastle.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>TRIUMPHAL DEPARTURE&mdash;NO SEASON LIKE YOUTH&mdash;EXTREME
OLD AGE&mdash;BEAUTIFUL ENGLAND&mdash;THE RATCATCHER&mdash;A
MISADVENTURE</p>
<p>I departed from the inn much in the same fashion as I had come
to it, mounted on a splendid horse indifferently well
caparisoned, with the small valise attached to my crupper, in
which, besides the few things I had brought with me, was a small
book of roads with a map, which had been presented to me by the
landlord.&nbsp; I must not forget to state that I did not ride
out of the yard, but that my horse was brought to me at the front
door by old Bill, who insisted upon doing so, and who refused a
five-shilling piece which I offered him; and it will be as well
to let the reader know that the landlord shook me by the hand as
I mounted, and that the people attached to the inn, male and
female&mdash;my friend the postillion at the head&mdash;assembled
before the house to see me off, and gave me three cheers as I
rode away.&nbsp; Perhaps no person ever departed from an inn with
more &eacute;clat or better wishes; nobody looked at me askance,
except two stage-coachmen who were loitering about, one of whom
said to his companion, &lsquo;I say, Jim! twig his portmanteau! a
regular Newmarket turn out by ---!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was in the cool of the evening of a bright day&mdash;all
the days of that summer were bright&mdash;that I departed.&nbsp;
I felt at first rather melancholy at finding myself again
launched into the wide world, and leaving the friends <!-- page
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>whom I had lately made behind me; but by occasionally
trotting the horse, and occasionally singing a song of Romanvile,
<a name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a> I had dispelled the feeling of
melancholy by the time I had proceeded three miles down the main
road.&nbsp; It was at the end of these three miles, just opposite
a milestone, that I struck into a cross road.&nbsp; After riding
about seven miles, threading what are called, in postillion
parlance, cross-country roads, I reached another high road,
tending to the east, along which I proceeded for a mile or two,
when coming to a small inn, about nine o&rsquo;clock, I halted
and put up for the night.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning I proceeded on my journey, but
fearing to gall the horse, I no longer rode him, but led him by
the bridle, until I came to a town at the distance of about ten
miles from the place where I had passed the night.&nbsp; Here I
stayed during the heat of the day, more on the horse&rsquo;s
account than my own, and towards evening resumed my journey,
leading the animal by the bridle as before; and in this manner I
proceeded for several days, travelling on an average from twenty
to twenty-five miles a day, always leading the animal, except
perhaps now and then of an evening, when, if I saw a good piece
of road before me, I would mount and put the horse into a trot,
which the creature seemed to enjoy as much as myself, showing his
satisfaction by snorting and neighing, whilst I gave utterance to
my own exhilaration by shouts, or by &lsquo;the chi she is kaulo
she soves pr&eacute; lakie dumo,&rsquo; <a
name="citation182b"></a><a href="#footnote182b"
class="citation">[182b]</a> or by something else of the same kind
in Romanvile.</p>
<p>On the whole, I journeyed along very pleasantly, certainly
quite as pleasantly as I do at present, now that I am become a
gentleman, and weigh sixteen stone, though some people would say
that my present manner of travelling is much the most preferable,
riding as I now do, instead of leading my horse; receiving the
homage of ostlers instead of their familiar nods; sitting down to
dinner in the parlour of the best inn I can find, instead of
passing the brightest part of the day in the kitchen of a <!--
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>village alehouse; carrying on my argument after dinner
on the subject of the corn-laws, with the best commercial
gentlemen on the road, instead of being glad, whilst sipping a
pint of beer, to get into conversation with blind trampers, or
maimed Abraham sailors, <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a> regaling
themselves on half-pints at the said village hostelries.&nbsp;
Many people will doubtless say that things have altered
wonderfully with me for the better, and they would say right,
provided I possessed now what I then carried about with me in my
journeys&mdash;the spirit of youth.&nbsp; Youth is the only
season for enjoyment, and the first twenty-five years of
one&rsquo;s life are worth all the rest of the longest life of
man, even though those five-and-twenty be spent in penury and
contempt, and the rest in the possession of wealth, honours,
respectability, ay, and many of them in strength and health, such
as will enable one to ride forty miles before dinner, and over
one&rsquo;s pint of port&mdash;for the best gentleman in the land
should not drink a bottle&mdash;carry on one&rsquo;s argument,
with gravity and decorum, with any commercial gentleman who,
responsive to one&rsquo;s challenge, takes the part of common
sense and humanity against &lsquo;protection&rsquo; and the lord
of land.</p>
<p>Ah! there is nothing like youth&mdash;not that after-life is
valueless.&nbsp; Even in extreme old age one may get on very
well, provided we will but accept of the bounties of God.&nbsp; I
met the other day an old man, who asked me to drink.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am not thirsty,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and will not drink
with you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, you will,&rsquo; said the old
man, &lsquo;for I am this day one hundred years old; and you will
never again have an opportunity of drinking the health of a man
on his hundredth birthday.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I broke my word, and
drank.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yours is a wonderful age,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a long time to look back to the
beginning of it,&rsquo; said the old man: &lsquo;yet, upon the
whole, I am not sorry to have lived it all.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;How have you passed your time?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;As well as I could,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;always
enjoying a good thing when it came honestly within my reach; not
forgetting to praise God for putting it there.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I suppose you were fond of a glass of good ale when you
were young?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;I was; and so, thank God, I am still.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
drank off a glass of ale.</p>
<p>On I went in my journey, traversing England from west to
east&mdash;ascending and descending hills&mdash;crossing rivers
<!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>by bridge and ferry&mdash;and passing over extensive
plains.&nbsp; What a beautiful country is England!&nbsp; People
run abroad to see beautiful countries, and leave their own behind
unknown, unnoticed&mdash;their own the most beautiful!&nbsp; And
then, again, what a country for adventures! especially to those
who travel it on foot, or on horseback.&nbsp; People run abroad
in quest of adventures, and traverse Spain and Portugal on mule
or on horseback; whereas there are ten times more adventures to
be met with in England than in Spain, Portugal, or stupid Germany
to boot.&nbsp; Witness the number of adventures narrated in the
present book&mdash;a book entirely devoted to England.&nbsp; Why,
there is not a chapter in the present book which is not full of
adventures, with the exception of the present one, and this is
not yet terminated.</p>
<p>After traversing two or three counties, I reached the confines
of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; During one particularly hot day I put up
at a public-house, to which, in the evening, came a party of
harvesters to make merry, who, finding me wandering about the
house a stranger, invited me to partake of their ale; so I drank
with the harvesters, who sang me songs about rural life, such
as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sitting in the swale; and listening to the
swindle of the flail, as it sounds dub-a-dub on the corn, from
the neighbouring barn.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In requital for which I treated them with a song, not of
Romanvile, but the song of &lsquo;Sivord and the horse
Grayman.&rsquo;&nbsp; I remained with them till it was dark,
having, after sunset, entered into deep discourse with a
celebrated ratcatcher, who communicated to me the secrets of his
trade, saying, amongst other things, &lsquo;When you see the rats
pouring out of their holes, and running up my hands and arms,
it&rsquo;s not after me they comes, but after the oils I carries
about me they comes;&rsquo; and who subsequently spoke in the
most enthusiastic manner of his trade, saying that it was the
best trade in the world, and most diverting, and that it was
likely to last for ever; for whereas all other kinds of vermin
were fast disappearing from England, rats were every day becoming
more abundant.&nbsp; I had quitted this good company, and having
mounted my horse, was making my way towards a town at about six
miles&rsquo; distance, at a swinging trot, my thoughts deeply
engaged on what I had gathered from the ratcatcher, when all on
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>a sudden a light glared upon the horse&rsquo;s face,
who purled round in great terror, and flung me out of the saddle,
as from a sling, or with as much violence as the horse Grayman,
in the ballad, flings Sivord the Snareswayne.&nbsp; I fell upon
the ground&mdash;felt a kind of crashing about my neck&mdash;and
forthwith became senseless.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>NOVEL SITUATION&mdash;THE ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL&mdash;THE
SURGEON&mdash;A KIND OFFER&mdash;CHIMERICAL IDEAS&mdash;STRANGE
DREAM</p>
<p>How long I remained senseless I cannot say; for a considerable
time I believe; at length, opening my eyes, I found myself lying
on a bed in a middle-sized chamber, lighted by a candle, which
stood on a table; an elderly man stood near me, and a yet more
elderly female was holding a phial of very pungent salts to my
olfactory organ.&nbsp; I attempted to move, but felt very
stiff&mdash;my right arm appeared nearly paralyzed, and there was
a strange dull sensation in my head.&nbsp; &lsquo;You had better
remain still, young man,&rsquo; said the elderly individual,
&lsquo;the surgeon will be here presently; I have sent a message
for him to the neighbouring village.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where am
I?&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and what has happened?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are in my house,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;and
you have been flung from a horse.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that I
was the cause.&nbsp; As I was driving home, the lights in my gig
frightened the animal.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is the
horse?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Below, in my stable,&rsquo;
said the elderly individual.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw you fall, but
knowing that on account of my age I could be of little use to
you, I instantly hurried home; the accident did not occur more
than a furlong off, and procuring the assistance of my lad, and
two or three neighbouring cottagers, I returned to the spot where
you were lying senseless.&nbsp; We raised you up, and brought you
here.&nbsp; My lad then went in quest of the horse, who had run
away as we drew nigh.&nbsp; When we saw him first, he was
standing near you; he caught him with some difficulty, and
brought him home.&nbsp; What are you about?&rsquo; said the old
man, as I strove to get off the bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to see
the horse,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I entreat you to be
still,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;the horse is safe, I <!--
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>assure you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am thinking about his
knees,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Instead of thinking about your
horse&rsquo;s knees,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;be thankful
that you have not broke your own neck.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You do
not talk wisely,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;when a man&rsquo;s neck is
broke he is provided for; but when his horse&rsquo;s knees are
broke he is a lost jockey, that is if he has nothing but his
horse to depend upon.&nbsp; A pretty figure I should cut at
Horncastle, mounted on a horse blood-raw at the
knees.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, you are going to
Horncastle,&rsquo; said the old man seriously, &lsquo;then I can
sympathize with you in your anxiety about your horse, being a
Lincolnshire man, and the son of one who bred horses.&nbsp; I
will myself go down into the stable and examine into the
condition of your horse, so pray remain quiet till I return; it
would certainly be a terrible thing to appear at Horncastle on a
broken-kneed horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He left the room and returned at the end of about ten minutes,
followed by another person.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your horse is
safe,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and his knees are unblemished; not a
hair ruffled.&nbsp; He is a fine animal, and will do credit to
Horncastle; but here is the surgeon come to examine into your own
condition.&rsquo;&nbsp; The surgeon was a man about thirty-five,
thin and rather tall; his face was long and pale, and his hair,
which was light, was carefully combed back as much as possible
from his forehead.&nbsp; He was dressed very neatly, and spoke in
a very precise tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Allow me to feel your pulse,
friend?&rsquo; said he, taking me by the right wrist.&nbsp; I
uttered a cry, for at the motion which he caused a thrill of
agony darted through my arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;I hope your arm is not
broke, my friend,&rsquo; said the surgeon; &lsquo;allow me to
see.&nbsp; First of all, we must divest you of this cumbrous
frock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The frock was removed with some difficulty, and then the upper
vestments of my frame, with more difficulty still.&nbsp; The
surgeon felt my arm, moving it up and down, causing me
unspeakable pain.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no fracture,&rsquo; said
he, at last, &lsquo;but a contusion&mdash;a violent
contusion.&nbsp; I am told you were going to Horncastle: I am
afraid you will be hardly able to ride your horse thither in time
to dispose of him; however, we shall see; your arm must be
bandaged, friend; after which I will bleed you, and administer a
composing draught.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To be short, the surgeon did as he proposed, and when he had
administered the composing draught, he said, <!-- page 187--><a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>&lsquo;Be
of good cheer; I should not be surprised if you are yet in time
for Horncastle.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then departed with the master of
the house, and the woman, leaving me to my repose.&nbsp; I soon
began to feel drowsy, and was just composing myself to slumber,
lying on my back, as the surgeon had advised me, when I heard
steps ascending the stairs, and in a moment more the surgeon
entered again, followed by the master of the house.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t disturb you,&rsquo; said the former;
&lsquo;my reason for returning is to relieve your mind from any
anxiety with respect to your horse.&nbsp; I am by no means sure
that you will be able, owing to your accident, to reach
Horncastle in time; to quiet you, however, I will buy your horse
for any reasonable sum.&nbsp; I have been down to the stable, and
approve of his figure.&nbsp; What do you ask for
him?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a strange time of night,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;to come to me about purchasing my horse, and I am
hardly in a fitting situation to be applied to about such a
matter.&nbsp; What do you want him for?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;For
my own use,&rsquo; said the surgeon; &lsquo;I am a professional
man, and am obliged to be continually driving about; I cover at
least one hundred and fifty miles every week.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;He will never answer your purpose,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;he is not a driving horse, and was never between shafts in
his life; he is for riding, more especially for trotting, at
which he has few equals.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It matters not to me
whether he is for riding or driving,&rsquo; said the surgeon;
&lsquo;sometimes I ride, sometimes drive; so if we can come to
terms, I will buy him, though remember it is chiefly to remove
any anxiety from your mind about him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;This is
no time for bargaining,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you wish to have
the horse for a hundred guineas, you may; if
not&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A hundred guineas!&rsquo; said the
surgeon.&nbsp; &lsquo;My good friend, you must surely be
light-headed; allow me to feel your pulse,&rsquo; and he
attempted to feel my left wrist.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not
light-headed,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and I require no one to feel
my pulse; but I should be light-headed if I were to sell my horse
for less than I have demanded; but I have a curiosity to know
what you would be willing to offer.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thirty
pounds,&rsquo; said the surgeon, &lsquo;is all I can afford to
give, and that is a great deal for a country surgeon to offer for
a horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thirty pounds,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;why he cost me nearly double that sum.&nbsp; To tell you
the truth, I am afraid you want to take advantage of my
situation.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not in the least, friend,&rsquo;
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>said the surgeon&mdash;&lsquo;not in the least; I only
wished to set your mind at rest about your horse; but as you
think he is worth more than I can afford to offer, take him to
Horncastle by all means; I will do my best to cure you in
time.&nbsp; Good night, I will see you again on the
morrow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he once more departed with the
master of the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;A sharp one,&rsquo; I heard him
say, with a laugh, as the door closed upon him.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I again essayed to compose myself to rest, but
for some time in vain.&nbsp; I had been terribly shaken by my
fall, and had subsequently, owing to the incision of the
surgeon&rsquo;s lancet, been deprived of much of the vital fluid;
it is when the body is in such a state that the merest trifles
affect and agitate the mind; no wonder, then, that the return of
the surgeon and the master of the house for the purpose of
inquiring whether I would sell my horse, struck me as being
highly extraordinary, considering the hour of the night, and the
situation in which they knew me to be.&nbsp; What could they mean
by such conduct&mdash;did they wish to cheat me of the
animal?&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if they
did, what matters, they found their match; yes, yes,&rsquo; said
I, &lsquo;but I am in their power, perhaps&rsquo;&mdash;but I
instantly dismissed the apprehension which came into my mind,
with a pooh, nonsense! in a little time, however, a far more
foolish and chimerical idea began to disturb me&mdash;the idea of
being flung from my horse? was I not disgraced for ever as a
horseman by being flung from my horse?&nbsp; Assuredly, I
thought; and the idea of being disgraced as a horseman, operating
on my nervous system, caused me very acute misery.&nbsp;
&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; said I to myself, &lsquo;it was perhaps
the contemptible opinion which the surgeon must have formed of my
equestrian powers, which induced him to offer to take my horse
off my hands; he perhaps thought I was unable to manage a horse,
and therefore in pity returned in the dead of night to offer to
purchase the animal which had flung me; and then the thought that
the surgeon had conceived a contemptible opinion of my equestrian
powers, caused me the acutest misery, and continued tormenting me
until some other idea (I have forgot what it was, but doubtless
equally foolish) took possession of my mind.&nbsp; At length,
brought on by the agitation of my spirits, there came over me the
same feeling of horror that I had experienced of old when I was a
boy, and likewise of late within the dingle; it <!-- page
189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>was, however, not so violent as it had been on those
occasions, and I struggled manfully against it, until by degrees
it passed away, and then I fell asleep; and in my sleep I had an
ugly dream.&nbsp; I dreamt that I had died of the injuries I had
received from my fall, and that no sooner had my soul departed
from my body than it entered that of a quadruped, even my own
horse in the stable&mdash;in a word, I was, to all intents and
purposes, my own steed; and as I stood in the stable chewing hay
(and I remember that the hay was exceedingly tough), the door
opened, and the surgeon who had attended me came in.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My good animal,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;as your late master
has scarcely left enough to pay for the expenses of his funeral,
and nothing to remunerate me for my trouble, I shall make bold to
take possession of you.&nbsp; If your paces are good, I shall
keep you for my own riding; if not I shall take you to
Horncastle, your original destination.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then
bridled and saddled me, and, leading me out, mounted, and then
trotted me up and down before the house, at the door of which the
old man, who now appeared to be dressed in regular jockey
fashion, was standing.&nbsp; &lsquo;I like his paces well,&rsquo;
said the surgeon; &lsquo;I think I shall take him for my own
use.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And what am I to have for all the
trouble his master caused me?&rsquo; said my late entertainer, on
whose countenance I now observed, for the first time, a
diabolical squint.&nbsp; &lsquo;The consciousness of having done
your duty to a fellow-creature in succouring him in a time of
distress, must be your reward,&rsquo; said the surgeon.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pretty gammon, truly,&rsquo; said my late entertainer;
&lsquo;what would you say if I were to talk in that way to
you?&nbsp; Come, unless you choose to behave jonnock, <a
name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a> I shall take the bridle and lead the
horse back into the stable.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said
the surgeon, &lsquo;we are old friends, and I don&rsquo;t wish to
dispute with you, so I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do; I will
ride the animal to Horncastle, and we will share what he fetches
like brothers.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;but if you say that you have sold him for less than a
hundred, I shan&rsquo;t consider you jonnock; remember what the
young fellow said&mdash;that young fellow&mdash;.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
heard no more, for the next moment I found myself on a broad road
leading, as I supposed, in the direction of Horncastle, the
surgeon still in the saddle, and my legs moving at a rapid
trot.&nbsp; <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>&lsquo;Get on,&rsquo; said the
surgeon, jerking my mouth with the bit; whereupon, full of rage,
I instantly set off at a full gallop, determined, if possible, to
dash my rider to the earth.&nbsp; The surgeon, however, kept his
seat, and, so far from attempting to abate my speed, urged me on
to greater efforts with a stout stick, which methought he held in
his hand.&nbsp; In vain did I rear and kick, attempting to get
rid of my foe; but the surgeon remained as saddle-fast as ever
the Maugrabin sorcerer in the Arabian tale what time he rode the
young prince transformed into a steed to his enchanted palace in
the wilderness.&nbsp; At last, as I was still madly dashing on,
panting and blowing, and had almost given up all hope, I saw at a
distance before me a heap of stones by the side of the road,
probably placed there for the purpose of repairing it; a thought
appeared to strike me&mdash;I will shy at those stones, and if I
can&rsquo;t get rid of him so, resign myself to my fate.&nbsp; So
I increased my speed, till arriving within about ten yards of the
heap, I made a desperate start, turning half round with nearly
the velocity of a millstone.&nbsp; Oh, the joy I experienced when
I felt my enemy canted over my neck, and saw him lying senseless
in the road.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have you now in my power,&rsquo; I
said, or rather neighed, as, going up to my prostrate foe, I
stood over him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Suppose I were to rear now, and let
my fore feet fall upon you, what would your life be worth? that
is, supposing you are not killed already; but lie there, I will
do you no farther harm, but trot to Horncastle without a rider,
and when there&mdash;&rsquo; and without further reflection off I
trotted in the direction of Horncastle, but had not gone far
before my bridle, falling from my neck, got entangled with my off
fore foot.&nbsp; I felt myself falling, a thrill of agony shot
through me&mdash;my knees would be broken, and what should I do
at Horncastle with a pair of broken knees?&nbsp; I struggled, but
I could not disengage my off fore foot, and downward I fell, but
before I had reached the ground I awoke, and found myself half
out of bed, my bandaged arm in considerable pain, and my left
hand just touching the floor.</p>
<p>With some difficulty I readjusted myself in bed.&nbsp; It was
now early morning, and the first rays of the sun were beginning
to penetrate the white curtains of a window on my left, which
probably looked into a garden, as I caught a glimpse or two of
the leaves of trees through a small uncovered part at the
side.&nbsp; For some <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>time I felt uneasy and anxious, my
spirits being in a strange fluttering state.&nbsp; At last my
eyes fell upon a small row of tea-cups, seemingly of china, which
stood on a mantelpiece exactly fronting the bottom of the
bed.&nbsp; The sight of these objects, I know not why, soothed
and pacified me; I kept my eyes fixed upon them, as I lay on my
back on the bed, with my head upon the pillow, till at last I
fell into a calm and refreshing sleep.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<p>THE MORNING AFTER A FALL&mdash;THE TEAPOT&mdash;UNPRETENDING
HOSPITALITY&mdash;THE CHINESE STUDENT</p>
<p>It might be about eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning when I
was awakened by the entrance of the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
have you rested?&rsquo; said he, coming up to the bedside, and
looking me in the face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and I feel much better, but I am still very
sore.&rsquo;&nbsp; I surveyed him now for the first time with
attention.&nbsp; He was dressed in a sober-coloured suit, and was
apparently between sixty and seventy.&nbsp; In stature he was
rather above the middle height, but with a slight stoop, his
features were placid, and expressive of much benevolence, but, as
it appeared to me, with rather a melancholy cast&mdash;as I gazed
upon them, I felt ashamed that I should ever have conceived in my
brain a vision like that of the preceding night, in which he
appeared in so disadvantageous a light.&nbsp; At length he said,
&lsquo;It is now time for you to take some refreshment.&nbsp; I
hear my old servant coming up with your breakfast.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In a moment the elderly female entered with a tray, on which was
some bread and butter, a teapot and cup.&nbsp; The cup was of
common blue earthenware, but the pot was of china, curiously
fashioned, and seemingly of great antiquity.&nbsp; The old man
poured me out a cupful of tea, and then, with the assistance of
the woman, raised me higher, and propped me up with
pillows.&nbsp; I ate and drank; when the pot was emptied of its
liquid (it did not contain much), I raised it up with my left
hand to inspect it.&nbsp; The sides were covered with curious
characters, seemingly hieroglyphics.&nbsp; After surveying them
for some time, I replaced it upon the tray.&nbsp; &lsquo;You seem
fond of china,&rsquo; said I to the old man, after the servant
had retired <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>with the breakfast things, and I had
returned to my former posture; &lsquo;you have china on the
mantelpiece, and that was a remarkable teapot out of which I have
just been drinking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man fixed his eyes intently on me, and methought the
expression of his countenance became yet more melancholy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said he, at last, &lsquo;I am fond of
china&mdash;I have reason to be fond of china&mdash;but for china
I should&mdash;&rsquo; and here he sighed again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You value it for the quaintness and singularity of its
form,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;it appears to be less adapted for
real use than our own pottery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I care little about its form,&rsquo; said the old man;
&lsquo;I care for it simply on account of&mdash;However, why talk
to you on a subject which can have no possible interest for
you?&nbsp; I expect the surgeon here presently.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not like that surgeon at all,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How strangely he behaved last night, coming back, when I
was just falling asleep, to ask me if I would sell my
horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has but one
failing,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;an itch for horse-dealing; but
for that he might be a much richer man than he is; he is
continually buying and exchanging horses, and generally finds
himself a loser by his bargains: but he is a worthy creature, and
skilful in his profession&mdash;it is well for you that you are
under his care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man then left me, and in about an hour returned with
the surgeon, who examined me and reported favourably as to my
case.&nbsp; He spoke to me with kindness and feeling, and did not
introduce the subject of the horse.&nbsp; I asked him whether he
thought I should be in time for the fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw some
people making their way thither to-day,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;the fair lasts three weeks, and it has just
commenced.&nbsp; Yes, I think I may promise you that you will be
in time for the very heat of it.&nbsp; In a few days you will be
able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling, but you must
by no means appear with your arm in a sling at Horncastle, as
people would think your horse had flung you, and that you wanted
to dispose of him because he was a vicious brute.&nbsp; You must,
by all means, drop the sling before you get to
Horncastle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For three days I kept my apartment by the advice of the
surgeon.&nbsp; I passed my time as I best could.&nbsp; Stretched
on my bed, I either abandoned myself to reflection, or <!-- page
193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>listened to the voices of the birds in the neighbouring
garden.&nbsp; Sometimes, as I lay awake at night, I would
endeavour to catch the tick of a clock, which methought sounded
from some distant part of the house.</p>
<p>The old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire
into my state.&nbsp; His words were few on these occasions, and
he did not stay long.&nbsp; Yet his voice and his words were
kind.&nbsp; What surprised me most in connection with this
individual was, the delicacy of conduct which he exhibited in not
letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify
curiosity respecting who I was, or whence I came.&nbsp; All he
knew of me was, that I had been flung from my horse on my way to
a fair for the purpose of disposing of the animal; and that I was
now his guest.&nbsp; I might be a common horse-dealer for what he
knew, yet I was treated by him with all the attention which I
could have expected had I been an alderman of Boston&rsquo;s
heir, and known to him as such.&nbsp; The county in which I am
now, thought I at last, must be either extraordinarily devoted to
hospitality, or this old host of mine must be an extraordinary
individual.&nbsp; On the evening of the fourth day, feeling tired
of my confinement, I put my clothes on in the best manner I
could, and left the chamber.&nbsp; Descending a flight of stairs,
I reached a kind of quadrangle, from which branched two or three
passages; one of these I entered, which had a door at the farther
end, and one on each side; the one to the left standing partly
open, I entered it, and found myself in a middle-sized room with
a large window, or rather glass-door, which looked into a garden,
and which stood open.&nbsp; There was nothing remarkable in this
room, except a large quantity of china.&nbsp; There was china on
the mantelpiece&mdash;china on two tables, and a small beaufet,
which stood opposite the glass-door, was covered with
china&mdash;there were cups, teapots, and vases of various forms,
and on all of them I observed characters&mdash;not a teapot, not
a teacup, not a vase of whatever form or size, but appeared to
possess hieroglyphics on some part or other.&nbsp; After
surveying these articles for some time with no little interest, I
passed into the garden, in which there were small parterres of
flowers, and two or three trees, and which, where the house did
not abut, was bounded by a wall.&nbsp; Turning to the right by a
walk by the side of the house, I passed by a door&mdash;probably
the one I had seen at the <!-- page 194--><a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>end of the
passage&mdash;and arrived at another window similar to that
through which I had come, and which also stood open.&nbsp; I was
about to pass by it, when I heard the voice of my entertainer
exclaiming, &lsquo;Is that you?&nbsp; Pray come in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I entered the room, which seemed to be a counterpart of the
one which I had just left.&nbsp; It was of the same size, had the
same kind of furniture, and appeared to be equally well stocked
with china; one prominent article it possessed, however, which
the other room did not exhibit&mdash;namely, a clock, which, with
its pendulum moving tick-a-tick, hung against the wall opposite
to the door, the sight of which made me conclude that the sound
which methought I had heard in the stillness of the night was not
an imaginary one.&nbsp; There it hung on the wall, with its
pendulum moving tick-a-tick.&nbsp; The old gentleman was seated
in an easy chair a little way into the room, having the glass
door on his right hand.&nbsp; On a table before him lay a large
open volume, in which I observed Roman letters as well as
characters.&nbsp; A few inches beyond the book on the table,
covered all over with hieroglyphics, stood a china vase.&nbsp;
The eyes of the old man were fixed upon it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said he, motioning me with his hand to
a stool close by, but without taking his eyes from the
vase.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rsquo; said he, at
last, removing his eyes from the vase, and leaning back on the
chair&mdash;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could assist you,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Assist me,&rsquo; said the old man, looking at me, with
a half smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t understand
Chinese.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose not,&rsquo; said the old man, with another
slight smile; &lsquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray proceed,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wished to ask you,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;how you knew that the characters on yon piece of crockery
were Chinese; or, indeed, that there was such a
language?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew the crockery was china,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;and naturally enough supposed what was written upon it to
be Chinese; as for there being such a language&mdash;the English
have a language, the French have a language, and why not the
Chinese?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I ask you a question?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&lsquo;As many as you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know any language besides English?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I know a little of two or
three.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I ask their names?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know a little
French.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, a little Welsh, and a little Haik.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is Haik?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Armenian.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to see you in my house,&rsquo; said the old
man, shaking me by the hand; &lsquo;how singular that one coming
as you did should know Armenian!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not more singular,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;than that one
living in such a place as this should know Chinese.&nbsp; How
came you to acquire it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at me, and sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I beg
pardon,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for asking what is, perhaps, an
impertinent question; I have not imitated your own delicacy; you
have never asked me a question without first desiring permission,
and here I have been days and nights in your house an intruder on
your hospitality, and you have never so much as asked me who I
am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In forbearing to do that,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;I merely obeyed the Chinese precept: &ldquo;Ask no
questions of a guest;&rdquo; it is written on both sides of the
teapot out of which you have had your tea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I knew Chinese,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
it a difficult language to acquire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have reason to think so,&rsquo; said the old
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been occupied upon it five-and-thirty
years, and I am still very imperfectly acquainted with it; at
least, I frequently find upon my crockery sentences the meaning
of which to me is very dark, though it is true these sentences
are mostly verses, which are, of course, more difficult to
understand than mere prose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are your Chinese studies,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;confined to crockery literature?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Entirely,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;I read
nothing else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that the Chinese
have no letters, but that for every word they have a separate
character&mdash;is it so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For every word they have a particular character,&rsquo;
said the old man; &lsquo;though, to prevent confusion, they have
arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen <!-- page
196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>what we should call radicals, but which they call
keys.&nbsp; As we arrange all our words in a dictionary under
twenty-four letters, so do they arrange all their words, or
characters, under two hundred and fourteen radical signs; the
simplest radicals being the first and the more complex the
last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does the Chinese resemble any of the European languages
in words?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am scarcely competent to inform you,&rsquo; said the
old man; &lsquo;but I believe not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does that character represent?&rsquo; said I,
pointing to one on the vase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A knife,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;that character
is one of the simplest radicals or keys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is the sound of it?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tau,&rsquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tau!&rsquo; said I&mdash;&lsquo;tau!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A strange word for a knife! is it not?&rsquo; said the
old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tawse!&rsquo; said I&mdash;&lsquo;tawse!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is tawse?&rsquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were never at school at Edinburgh, I
suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That accounts for your not knowing the meaning of
tawse,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;had you received the rudiments of a
classical education at the High School, you would have known the
meaning of tawse full well.&nbsp; It is a leathern thong, with
which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of their duty by
the dominie.&nbsp; Tau&mdash;tawse&mdash;how singular!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot see what the two words have in common, except
a slight agreement in sound.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see the connection,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;when
I inform you that the thong, from the middle to the bottom, is
cut or slit into two or three parts, from which slits or cuts,
unless I am very much mistaken, it derives its name&mdash;tawse,
a thong with slits or cuts, used for chastising disorderly
urchins at the High School, from the French tailler, to cut;
evidently connected with the Chinese tau, a knife&mdash;how very
extraordinary!&rsquo;</p>

<p>CONVALESCENCE&mdash;THE SURGEON&rsquo;S BILL&mdash;LETTER OF
RECOMMENDATION&mdash;COMMENCEMENT OF THE OLD MAN&rsquo;S
HISTORY</p>
<p>Two days&mdash;three days passed away&mdash;and I still
remained at the house of my hospitable entertainer: my bruised
limb rapidly recovering the power of performing its
functions.&nbsp; I passed my time agreeably enough, sometimes in
my chamber, communing with my own thoughts; sometimes in the
stable, attending to, and not unfrequently conversing with, my
horse; and at mealtime&mdash;for I seldom saw him at any
other&mdash;discoursing with the old gentleman, sometimes on the
Chinese vocabulary, sometimes on Chinese syntax, and once or
twice on English horseflesh; though on this latter subject,
notwithstanding his descent from a race of horse traders, he did
not enter with much alacrity.&nbsp; As a small requital for his
kindness, I gave him one day, after dinner, unasked, a brief
account of my history and pursuits.&nbsp; He listened with
attention; and when it was concluded, thanked me for the
confidence which I had reposed in him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Such
conduct,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;deserves a return.&nbsp; I will
tell you my own history: it is brief, but may perhaps not prove
uninteresting to you&mdash;though the relation of it will give me
some pain.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray, then, do not recite
it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;I will tell you, for I wish you to know it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He was about to begin when he was interrupted by the arrival of
the surgeon.&nbsp; The surgeon examined into the state of my
bruised limb, and told me, what indeed I already well knew, that
it was rapidly improving.&nbsp; &lsquo;You will not even require
a sling,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to ride to Horncastle.&nbsp; When
do you propose going?&rsquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &lsquo;When do
you think I may venture?&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think,
if you are a tolerably good horseman, you may mount the day after
to-morrow,&rsquo; answered the medical man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;By-the-by, are you acquainted with anybody at
Horncastle?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;With no living soul,&rsquo; I
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then you would scarcely find stable room
for your horse.&nbsp; But I am happy to be able to assist
you.&nbsp; I have a friend there who keeps a small inn, and who,
during the time of the fair, keeps a stall vacant for any
quadruped I may bring, until he <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>knows
whether I am coming or not.&nbsp; I will give you a letter to
him, and he will see after the accommodation of your horse.&nbsp;
To-morrow I will pay you a farewell visit, and bring you the
letter.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and
do not forget to bring your bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; The surgeon looked
at the old man, who gave him a peculiar nod.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said he, in reply to me, &lsquo;for the little
service I have rendered you I require no remuneration.&nbsp; You
are in my friend&rsquo;s house, and he and I understand each
other.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I never receive such favours,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;as you have rendered me, without remunerating
them; therefore I shall expect your bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh!
just as you please,&rsquo; said the surgeon; and, shaking me by
the hand more warmly than he had hitherto done, he took his
leave.</p>
<p>On the evening of the next day, the last which I spent with my
kind entertainer, I sat at tea with him in a little summer-house
in his garden, partially shaded by the boughs of a large
fig-tree.&nbsp; The surgeon had shortly before paid me his
farewell visit, and had brought me the letter of introduction to
his friend at Horncastle, and also his bill, which I found
anything but extravagant.&nbsp; After we had each respectively
drank the contents of two cups&mdash;and it may not be amiss here
to inform the reader that though I took cream with my tea, as I
always do when I can procure that addition, the old man, like
most people bred up in the country drank his without it&mdash;he
thus addressed me: &lsquo;I am, as I told you on the night of
your accident, the son of a breeder of horses, a respectable and
honest man.&nbsp; When I was about twenty he died, leaving me,
his only child, a comfortable property, consisting of about two
hundred acres of land and some fifteen hundred pounds in
money.&nbsp; My mother had died about three years
previously.&nbsp; I felt the death of my mother keenly, but that
of my father less than was my duty; indeed, truth compels me to
acknowledge that I scarcely regretted his death.&nbsp; The cause
of this want of proper filial feeling was the opposition which I
had experienced from him in an affair which deeply concerned
me.&nbsp; I had formed an attachment for a young female in the
neighbourhood, who, though poor, was of highly respectable birth,
her father having been a curate of the Established Church.&nbsp;
She was, at the time of which I am speaking, an orphan, having
lost both her parents, and supported herself by keeping a small
school.&nbsp; My attachment was returned, <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and we had
pledged our vows, but my father, who could not reconcile himself
to her lack of fortune, forbade our marriage in the most positive
terms.&nbsp; He was wrong, for she was a fortune in
herself&mdash;amiable and accomplished.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I cannot
tell you all she was&rsquo;&mdash;and here the old man drew his
hand across his eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the death of my father, the
only obstacle to our happiness appeared to be removed.&nbsp; We
agreed, therefore, that our marriage should take place within the
course of a year; and I forthwith commenced enlarging my house
and getting my affairs in order.&nbsp; Having been left in the
easy circumstances which I have described, I determined to follow
no business, but to pass my life in a strictly domestic manner,
and to be very, very happy.&nbsp; Amongst other property derived
from my father were several horses, which I disposed of in this
neighbourhood, with the exception of two remarkably fine ones,
which I determined to take to the next fair at Horncastle, the
only place where I expected to be able to obtain what I
considered to be their full value.&nbsp; At length the time
arrived for the commencement of the fair, which was within three
months of the period which my beloved and myself had fixed upon
for the celebration of our nuptials.&nbsp; To the fair I went, a
couple of trusty men following me with the horses.&nbsp; I soon
found a purchaser for the animals, a portly, plausible person <a
name="citation199"></a><a href="#footnote199"
class="citation">[199]</a> of about forty, dressed in a blue
riding coat, brown top boots, and leather breeches.&nbsp; There
was a strange-looking urchin with him, attired in nearly similar
fashion, with a beam in one of his eyes, who called him
father.&nbsp; The man paid me for the purchase in
bank-notes&mdash;three fifty-pound notes for the two
horses.&nbsp; As we were about to take leave of each other, he
suddenly produced another fifty-pound note, inquiring whether I
could change it, complaining at the same time of the difficulty
of procuring change in the fair.&nbsp; As I happened to have
plenty of small money in my possession, and as I felt obliged to
him for having purchased my horses at what I considered to be a
good price, I informed him that I should be very happy to
accommodate him; so I changed him the note, and he, having taken
possession of the horses, went his way, and I myself returned
home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A month passed; during this time I paid away two of
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>the notes which I had received at Horncastle from the
dealer&mdash;one of them in my immediate neighbourhood, and the
other at a town about fifteen miles distant, to which I had
repaired for the purpose of purchasing some furniture.&nbsp; All
things seemed to be going on most prosperously, and I felt quite
happy, when one morning, as I was overlooking some workmen who
were employed about my house, I was accosted by a constable, who
informed me that he was sent to request my immediate appearance
before a neighbouring bench of magistrates.&nbsp; Concluding that
I was merely summoned on some unimportant business connected with
the neighbourhood, I felt no surprise, and forthwith departed in
company with the officer.&nbsp; The demeanour of the man upon the
way struck me as somewhat singular.&nbsp; I had frequently spoken
to him before, and had always found him civil and respectful, but
he was now reserved and sullen, and replied to two or three
questions which I put to him in anything but a courteous
manner.&nbsp; On arriving at the place where the magistrates were
sitting&mdash;an inn at a small town about two miles
distant&mdash;I found a more than usual number of people
assembled, who appeared to be conversing with considerable
eagerness.&nbsp; At sight of me they became silent, but crowded
after me as I followed the man into the magistrates&rsquo;
room.&nbsp; There I found the tradesman to whom I had paid the
note for the furniture, at the town fifteen miles off, in
attendance, accompanied by an agent of the Bank of England; the
former, it seems, had paid the note into a provincial bank, the
proprietors of which, discovering it to be a forgery, had
forthwith written up to the Bank of England, who had sent down
their agent to investigate the matter.&nbsp; A third individual
stood beside them&mdash;the person in my own immediate
neighbourhood to whom I had paid the second note; this, by some
means or other, before the coming down of the agent, had found
its way to the same provincial bank, and also being pronounced a
forgery, it had speedily been traced to the person to whom I had
paid it.&nbsp; It was owing to the apparition of this second note
that the agent had determined, without further inquiry, to cause
me to be summoned before the rural tribunal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a few words the magistrates&rsquo; clerk gave me to
understand the state of the case.&nbsp; I was filled with
surprise and consternation.&nbsp; I knew myself to be perfectly
<!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>innocent of any fraudulent intention, but at the time
of which I am speaking it was a matter fraught with the greatest
danger to be mixed up, however innocently, with the passing of
false money.&nbsp; The law with respect to forgery was terribly
severe, and the innocent as well as the guily occasionally
suffered.&nbsp; Of this I was not altogether ignorant;
unfortunately, however, in my transactions with the stranger, the
idea of false notes being offered to me, and my being brought
into trouble by means of them, never entered my mind.&nbsp;
Recovering myself a little, I stated that the notes in question
were two of three notes which I had received at Horncastle, for a
pair of horses, which it was well known I had carried
thither.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thereupon, I produced from my pocket-book the third
note, which was forthwith pronounced a forgery.&nbsp; I had
scarcely produced the third note, when I remembered the one which
I had changed for the Horncastle dealer, and with the remembrance
came the almost certain conviction that it was also a forgery; I
was tempted for a moment to produce it, and to explain the
circumstances&mdash;would to God I had done so!&mdash;but shame
at the idea of having been so wretchedly duped prevented me, and
the opportunity was lost.&nbsp; I must confess that the agent of
the bank behaved, upon the whole, in a very handsome manner; he
said that as it was quite evident that I had disposed of certain
horses at the fair, it was very possible that I might have
received the notes in question in exchange for them, and that he
was willing, as he had received a very excellent account of my
general conduct, to press the matter no farther&mdash;that is,
provided&mdash;.&nbsp; And here he stopped.&nbsp; Thereupon, one
of the three magistrates, who were present, asked me whether I
chanced to have any more of these spurious notes in my
possession.&nbsp; He had certainly a right to ask the question,
but there was something peculiar in his tone&mdash;insinuating
suspicion.&nbsp; It is certainly difficult to judge of the
motives which rule a person&rsquo;s conduct, but I cannot help
imagining that he was somewhat influenced in his behaviour on
that occasion, which was anything but friendly, by my having
refused to sell him the horses at a price less than that which I
expected to get at the fair; be this as it may, the question
filled me with embarrassment, and I bitterly repented not having
at first been more explicit.&nbsp; Thereupon <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>the
magistrate, in the same kind of tone, demanded to see my
pocket-book.&nbsp; I knew that to demur would be useless, and
produced it, and forthwith amongst two or three small country
notes, appeared the fourth which I had received from the
Horncastle dealer.&nbsp; The agent, took it up and examined it
with attention.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, is it a genuine note,&rdquo;
said the magistrate?&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry to say that it is
not,&rdquo; said the agent; &ldquo;it is a forgery, like the
other three.&rdquo;&nbsp; The magistrate shrugged his shoulders,
as indeed did several people in the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;A regular
dealer in forged notes,&rdquo; said a person close behind me;
&ldquo;who would have thought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seeing matters begin to look so serious, I aroused
myself, and endeavoured to speak in my own behalf, giving a
candid account of the manner in which I became possessed of the
notes; but my explanation did not appear to meet much credit: the
magistrate, to whom I have in particular alluded, asked, why I
had not at once stated the fact of my having received a fourth
note; and the agent, though in a very quiet tone, observed that
he could not help thinking it somewhat strange that I should have
changed a note of so much value for a perfect stranger, even
supposing that he had purchased my horses, and had paid me their
value in hard cash; and I noticed that he laid a particular
emphasis on the last words.&nbsp; I might have observed that I
was an inexperienced young man, who meaning no harm myself,
suspected none in others, but I was confused, stunned, and my
tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of my mouth.&nbsp; The men
who had taken my horses to Horncastle, and for whom I had sent,
as they lived close at hand, now arrived, but the evidence which
they could give was anything but conclusive in my favour; they
had seen me in company with an individual at Horncastle, to whom
by my orders they had delivered certain horses, but they had seen
no part of the money transaction; the fellow, whether from design
or not, having taken me aside into a retired place, where he had
paid me the three spurious notes, and induced me to change the
fourth, which throughout the affair was what bore most materially
against me.&nbsp; How matters might have terminated I do not
know, I might have been committed to prison, and I might have
been&mdash;.&nbsp; Just then, when I most needed a friend, and
least expected to find one, for though amongst those <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>present there were several who were my neighbours, and
who had professed friendship for me, none of them when they saw
that I needed support and encouragement came forward to yield me
any, but, on the contrary, appeared by their looks to enjoy my
terror and confusion&mdash;just then a friend entered the room in
the person of the surgeon of the neighbourhood, the father of him
who has attended you; he was not on very intimate terms with me,
but he had occasionally spoken to me, and had attended my father
in his dying illness, and chancing to hear that I was in trouble,
he now hastened to assist me.&nbsp; After a short preamble, in
which he apologized to the bench for interfering, he begged to be
informed of the state of the case, whereupon the matter was laid
before him in all its details.&nbsp; He was not slow in taking a
fair view of it, and spoke well and eloquently in my
behalf&mdash;insisting on the improbability that a person of my
habits and position would be wilfully mixed up with a transaction
like that of which it appeared I was suspected&mdash;adding, that
as he was fully convinced of my innocence, he was ready to enter
into any surety with respect to my appearance at any time to
answer anything which might be laid to my charge.&nbsp; This last
observation had particular effect, and as he was a person
universally respected, both for his skill in his profession and
his general demeanour, people began to think that a person in
whom he took an interest could scarcely be concerned in anything
criminal, and though my friend the magistrate&mdash;I call him so
ironically&mdash;made two or three demurs, it was at last agreed
between him and his brethren of the bench, that, for the present,
I should be merely called upon to enter into my own recognizance
for the sum of two hundred pounds, to appear whenever it should
be deemed requisite to enter into any farther investigation of
the matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I was permitted to depart from the tribunal of petty
justice without handcuffs, and uncollared by a constable; but
people looked coldly and suspiciously upon me.&nbsp; The first
thing I did was to hasten to the house of my beloved, in order to
inform her of every circumstance attending the transaction.&nbsp;
I found her, but how?&nbsp; A malicious female individual had
hurried to her with a distorted tale, to the effect that I had
been taken up as an utterer of forged notes; that an immense
number had been found in my possession; that I was already
committed, <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>and that probably I should be
executed.&nbsp; My affianced one tenderly loved me, and her
constitution was delicate; fit succeeded fit, she broke a
blood-vessel, and I found her deluged in blood; the surgeon had
just been sent for; he came and afforded her every possible
relief.&nbsp; I was distracted; he bade me have hope, but I
observed he looked very grave.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the skill of the surgeon, the poor girl was saved in
the first instance from the arms of death, and for a few weeks
she appeared to be rapidly recovering; by degrees, however, she
became melancholy; a worm preyed upon her spirit; a slow fever
took possession of her frame.&nbsp; I subsequently learned that
the same malicious female, who had first carried to her an
exaggerated account of the affair, and who was a distant relative
of her own, frequently visited her, and did all in her power to
excite her fears with respect to its eventual termination.&nbsp;
Time passed on in a very wretched manner.&nbsp; Our friend the
surgeon showing to us both every mark of kindness and
attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was owing to this excellent man that my innocence
was eventually established.&nbsp; Having been called to a town on
the borders of Yorkshire to a medical consultation, he chanced to
be taking a glass of wine with the landlord of the inn at which
he stopped, when the waiter brought in a note to be changed,
saying, &ldquo;That the Quaker gentleman who had been for some
days in the house, and was about to depart, had sent it to be
changed, in order that he might pay his bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
landlord took the note and looked at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
fifty-pound bill,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
changing bills of that amount, lest they should prove bad ones;
however, as it comes from a Quaker gentleman, I suppose it is all
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mention of a fifty-pound note aroused the
attention of my friend, and he requested to be permitted to look
at it; he had scarcely seen it, when he was convinced that it was
one of the same description as those which had brought me into
trouble, as it corresponded with them in two particular features,
which the agent of the bank had pointed out to him and others as
evidence of their spuriousness.&nbsp; My friend, without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, informed the landlord that the note
was a bad one, expressing at the time a great wish to see the
Quaker gentleman who wanted to have it changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
you can easily do,&rdquo; said the <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>landlord,
and forthwith conducted him into the common room, where he saw a
respectable-looking man, dressed like a Quaker, and seemingly
about sixty years of age.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend, after a short apology, showed him the note
which he held in his hand, stating that he had no doubt it was a
spurious one, and begged to be informed where he had taken it,
adding, that a particular friend of his was at present in
trouble, owing to his having taken similar notes from a stranger
at Horncastle; but that he hoped that he, the Quaker, could give
information, by means of which the guilty party, or parties,
could be arrested.&nbsp; At the mention of Horncastle, it
appeared to my friend that the Quaker gave a slight start.&nbsp;
At the conclusion of this speech, however, he answered, with
great tranquillity, that he had received it in the way of
business at ---, naming one of the principal towns in Yorkshire,
from a very respectable person, whose name he was perfectly
willing to communicate, and likewise his own, which he said was
James, and that he was a merchant residing at Liverpool; that he
would write to his friend at ---, requesting him to make
inquiries on the subject; that just at that moment he was in a
hurry to depart, having some particular business at a town about
ten miles off, to go to which he had bespoken a post-chaise of
the landlord; that with respect to the note, it was doubtless a
very disagreeable thing to have a suspicious one in his
possession, but that it would make little difference to him, as
he had plenty of other money, and thereupon he pulled out a
purse, containing various other notes, and some gold, observing,
&ldquo;that his only motive for wishing to change the other note
was a desire to be well provided with change;&rdquo; and finally,
that if they had any suspicion with respect to him, he was
perfectly willing to leave the note in their possession till he
should return, which he intended to do in about a
fortnight.&nbsp; There was so much plausibility in the speech of
the Quaker, and his appearance and behaviour were so perfectly
respectable, that my friend felt almost ashamed of the suspicion
which at first he had entertained of him, though, at the same
time, he felt an unaccountable unwillingness to let the man
depart without some farther interrogation.&nbsp; The landlord,
however, who did not wish to disoblige one who had been, and
might probably be again, a profitable customer, declared that he
was perfectly satisfied; that he had no wish to detain the note,
which he made no doubt the gentleman had received in the way of
business, and that as the matter concerned him alone, he would
leave it to him to make the necessary inquiries.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Just as you please, friend,&rdquo; said the Quaker,
pocketing the suspicious note, &ldquo;I will now pay my
bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he discharged the bill with a
five-pound note, which he begged the landlord to inspect
carefully, and with two pieces of gold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The landlord had just taken the money, receipted the
bill, and was bowing to his customer, when the door opened, and a
lad, dressed in a kind of grey livery, appeared, and informed the
Quaker that the chaise was ready.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that boy your
servant?&rdquo; asked the surgeon.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is,
friend,&rdquo; said the Quaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hast thou any reason
for asking me that question?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And has he been
long in your service?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Several years,&rdquo;
replied the Quaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took him into my house out of
compassion, he being an orphan, but as the chaise is waiting, I
will bid thee farewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid I must
stop your journey for the present,&rdquo; said the surgeon;
&ldquo;that boy has exactly the same blemish in the eye which a
boy had who was in company with the man at Horncastle, from whom
my friend received the forged notes, and who there passed for his
son.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know nothing about that,&rdquo; said
the Quaker, &ldquo;but I am determined to be detained here no
longer, after the satisfactory account which I have given as to
the note&rsquo;s coming into my possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
attempted to leave the room, but my friend detained him, a
struggle ensued, during which a wig which the Quaker wore fell
off, whereupon he instantly appeared to lose some twenty years of
his age.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knock the fellow down, father,&rdquo; said
the boy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, forsooth, the pretended Quaker took the
boy&rsquo;s advice, and knocked my friend down in a
twinkling.&nbsp; The landlord, however, and waiter, seeing how
matters stood, instantly laid hold of him; but there can be no
doubt that he would have escaped from the whole three had not
certain guests who were in the house, hearing the noise, rushed
in, and helped to secure him.&nbsp; The boy was true to his word,
assisting him to the best of his ability, flinging himself
between the legs of his father&rsquo;s assailants, causing
several of them to stumble and fall.&nbsp; At length, the fellow
was secured, and led before a magistrate; the boy, to whom he was
heard to say something which <!-- page 207--><a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>nobody
understood, and to whom, after the man&rsquo;s capture, no one
paid much attention, was no more seen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rest, as far as this man was concerned, may be told
in a few words; nothing to criminate him was found on his person,
but on his baggage being examined, a quantity of spurious notes
were discovered.&nbsp; Much of his hardihood now forsook him, and
in the hope of saving his life he made some very important
disclosures; amongst other things, he confessed that it was he
who had given me the notes in exchange for the horses, and also
the note to be changed.&nbsp; He was subsequently tried on two
indictments, in the second of which I appeared against him.&nbsp;
He was condemned to die; but, in consideration of the disclosures
he had made, his sentence was commuted to perpetual
transportation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My innocence was thus perfectly established before the
eyes of the world, and all my friends hastened to congratulate
me.&nbsp; There was one who congratulated me more than all the
rest&mdash;it was my beloved one, but&mdash;but&mdash;she was
dying&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the old man drew his hand before his eyes and remained
for some time without speaking; at length he removed his hand,
and commenced again with a broken voice: &lsquo;You will pardon
me if I hurry over this part of my story; I am unable to dwell
upon it.&nbsp; How dwell upon a period when I saw my only earthly
treasure pine away gradually day by day, and knew that nothing
could save her!&nbsp; She saw my agony, and did all she could to
console me, saying that she was herself quite resigned.&nbsp; A
little time before her death she expressed a wish that we should
be united.&nbsp; I was too happy to comply with her
request.&nbsp; We were united, I brought her to this house,
where, in less than a week, she expired in my arms.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<p>THE OLD MAN&rsquo;S STORY CONTINUED&mdash;MISERY IN THE
HEAD&mdash;THE STRANGE MARKS&mdash;TEA-DEALER FROM
LONDON&mdash;DIFFICULTIES OF THE CHINESE LANGUAGE</p>
<p>After another pause the old man once more resumed his
narration: &lsquo;If ever there was a man perfectly miserable it
was myself, after the loss of that cherished woman.&nbsp; I sat
solitary in the house, in which I <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>had hoped
in her company to realize the choicest earthly happiness, a prey
to the bitterest reflections; many people visited and endeavoured
to console me&mdash;amongst them was the clergyman of the parish,
who begged me to be resigned, and told me that it was good to be
afflicted.&nbsp; I bowed my head, but I could not help thinking
how easy it must be for those who feel no affliction, to bid
others to be resigned, and to talk of the benefit resulting from
sorrow; perhaps I should have paid more attention to his
discourse than I did, provided he had been a person for whom it
was possible to entertain much respect, but his own heart was
known to be set on the things of this world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Within a little time he had an opportunity, in his own
case, of practising resignation, and of realizing the benefit of
being afflicted.&nbsp; A merchant, to whom he had entrusted all
his fortune, in the hope of a large interest, became suddenly a
bankrupt, with scarcely any assets.&nbsp; I will not say that it
was owing to this misfortune that the divine died within less
than a month after its occurrence, but such was the fact.&nbsp;
Amongst those who most frequently visited me was my friend the
surgeon; he did not confine himself to the common topics of
consolation, but endeavoured to impress upon me the necessity of
rousing myself, advising me to occupy my mind with some pursuit,
particularly recommending agriculture; but agriculture possessed
no interest for me, nor, indeed, any pursuit within my reach; my
hopes of happiness had been blighted, and what cared I for
anything; so at last he thought it best to leave me to myself,
hoping that time would bring with it consolation; and I remained
solitary in my house, waited upon by a male and a female
servant.&nbsp; Oh, what dreary moments I passed!&nbsp; My only
amusement&mdash;and it was a sad one&mdash;was to look at the
things which once belonged to my beloved, and which were now in
my possession.&nbsp; Oh, how fondly would I dwell upon
them!&nbsp; There were some books; I cared not for books, but
these had belonged to my beloved.&nbsp; Oh, how fondly did I
dwell on them!&nbsp; Then there was her hat and bonnet&mdash;oh,
me, how fondly did I gaze upon them! and after looking at her
things for hours, I would sit and ruminate on the happiness I had
lost.&nbsp; How I execrated the moment I had gone to the fair to
sell horses!&nbsp; &ldquo;Would that I had never been at
Horncastle <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>to sell horses!&rdquo; I would say;
&ldquo;I might at this moment have been enjoying the company of
my beloved, leading a happy, quiet, easy life, but for that fatal
expedition.&rdquo;&nbsp; That thought worked on my brain, till my
brain seemed to turn round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day I sat at the breakfast table gazing vacantly
around me, my mind was in a state of inexpressible misery; there
was a whirl in my brain, probably like that which people feel who
are rapidly going mad; this increased to such a degree that I
felt giddiness coming upon me.&nbsp; To abate this feeling I no
longer permitted my eyes to wander about, but fixed them upon an
object on the table, and continued gazing at it for several
minutes without knowing what it was.&nbsp; At length the misery
in my head was somewhat stilled, my lips moved, and I heard
myself saying, &ldquo;What odd marks!&rdquo;&nbsp; I had fastened
my eyes on the side of a teapot, and by keeping them fixed upon
it, had become aware of a fact that had escaped my notice
before&mdash;namely, that there were marks upon it.&nbsp; I kept
my eyes fixed upon them, and repeated at intervals, &ldquo;What
strange marks!&rdquo;&mdash;for I thought that looking upon the
marks tended to abate the whirl in my head.&nbsp; I kept tracing
the marks one after the other, and I observed that though they
all bore a resemblance to each other, they were all to a certain
extent different.&nbsp; The smallest portion possible of curious
interest had been awakened within me, and, at last, I asked
myself within my own mind, &ldquo;What motive could induce people
to put such odd marks on their crockery?&nbsp; They were not
pictures, they were not letters.&nbsp; What motive could people
have for putting them there?&rdquo;&nbsp; At last I removed my
eyes from the teapot, and thought for a few moments about the
marks; presently, however, I felt the whirl returning; the marks
became almost effaced from my mind, and I was beginning to revert
to my miserable ruminations, when suddenly methought I heard a
voice say, &ldquo;The marks! the marks! cling to the marks!
or&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; So I fixed my eyes again upon the marks,
inspecting them more attentively, if possible, than I had done
before, and, at last, I came to the conclusion that they were not
capricious or fanciful marks, but were arranged
systematically.&nbsp; When I had gazed at them for a considerable
time I turned the teapot round, and on the other side I observed
marks of a similar kind, which <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>I soon
discovered were identical with the ones I had been
observing.&nbsp; All the marks were something alike, but all
somewhat different, and on comparing them with each other, I was
struck with the frequent occurrence of a mark crossing an upright
line, or projecting from it, now on the right, now on the left
side, and I said to myself, &ldquo;Why does this mark sometimes
cross the upright line, and sometimes project?&rdquo; and the
more I thought on the matter the less did I feel of the misery in
my head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The things were at length removed, and I sat, as I had
for some time past been wont to sit after my meals, silent and
motionless; but in the present instance my mind was not entirely
abandoned to the one mournful idea which had so long distressed
it.&nbsp; It was, to a certain extent, occupied with the marks on
the teapot; it is true that the mournful idea strove hard with
the marks on the teapot for the mastery in my mind, and at last
the painful idea drove the marks of the teapot out.&nbsp; They,
however, would occasionally return and flit across my mind for a
moment or two, and their coming was like a momentary relief from
intense pain.&nbsp; I thought once or twice that I would have the
teapot placed before me, that I might examine the marks at
leisure, but I considered that it would be as well to defer the
re-examination of the marks till the next morning.&nbsp; At that
time I did not take tea of an evening.&nbsp; By deferring the
examination thus, I had something to look forward to on the next
morning.&nbsp; The day was a melancholy one, but it certainly was
more tolerable to me than any of the others had been since the
death of my beloved.&nbsp; As I lay awake that night I
occasionally thought of the marks, and in my sleep methought I
saw them upon the teapot vividly before me.&nbsp; On the morrow I
examined the marks again.&nbsp; How singular they looked!&nbsp;
Surely they must mean something, and if so, what could they mean?
and at last I thought within myself whether it would be possible
for me to make out what they meant.&nbsp; That day I felt more
relief than on the preceding day, and towards night I walked a
little about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In about a week&rsquo;s time I received a visit from my
friend the surgeon.&nbsp; After a little discourse, he told me
that he perceived I was better than when he had last seen me, and
asked me what I had been about.&nbsp; I told him that I had been
principally occupied in considering certain <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>marks which
I had found on a teapot, and wondering what they could
mean.&nbsp; He smiled at first, but instantly assuming a serious
look, he asked to see the teapot.&nbsp; I produced it, and after
having surveyed the marks with attention, he observed that they
were highly curious, and also wondered what they meant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I strongly advise you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to attempt
to make them out, and also to take moderate exercise, and to see
after your concerns.&rdquo;&nbsp; I followed his advice.&nbsp;
Every morning I studied the marks on the teapot, and in the
course of the day took moderate exercise, and attended to little
domestic matters, as became the master of a house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I subsequently learned that the surgeon, in advising me
to study the marks, and endeavour to make out their meaning,
merely hoped that by means of them my mind might by degrees be
diverted from the mournful idea on which it had so long
brooded.&nbsp; He was a man well skilled in his profession, but
had read and thought very little on matters unconnected with
it.&nbsp; He had no idea that the marks had any particular
signification, or were anything else but common and fortuitous
ones.&nbsp; That I became at all acquainted with their nature was
owing to a ludicrous circumstance which I will now relate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day, chancing to be at a neighbouring town, I was
struck with the appearance of a shop recently established.&nbsp;
It had an immense bow-window, and every part of it to which a
brush could be applied was painted in a gaudy flaming
style.&nbsp; Large bowls of green and black tea were placed upon
certain chests, which stood at the window.&nbsp; I stopped to
look at them; such a display, whatever it may be at the present
time, being, at the period of which I am speaking, quite uncommon
in a country town.&nbsp; The tea, whether black or green, was
very shining and inviting, and the bowls, of which there were
three, standing on as many chests, were very grand and
foreign-looking.&nbsp; Two of these were white, with figures and
trees painted upon them in blue; the other, which was the
middlemost, had neither trees nor figures upon it, but, as I
looked through the window, appeared to have on its sides the very
same kind of marks which I had observed on the teapot at home;
there were also marks on the tea-chests somewhat similar, but
much larger, and, apparently, not executed with so much
care.&nbsp; &ldquo;Best teas direct from China,&rdquo; said a
voice close to my <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>side, and looking round I saw a
youngish man with a frizzled head, flat face, and an immensely
wide mouth, standing in his shirt-sleeves by the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Direct from China,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps
you will do me the favour to walk in and scent them?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do not want any tea,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I was only
standing at the window examining those marks on the bowl and the
chests.&nbsp; I have observed similar ones on a teapot at
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray walk in, sir,&rdquo; said the
young fellow, extending his mouth till it reached nearly from ear
to ear&mdash;&ldquo;pray walk in, and I shall be happy to give
you any information respecting the manners and customs of the
Chinese in my power.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I followed him into
his shop, where he began to harangue on the manners, customs, and
peculiarities of the Chinese, especially their manner of
preparing tea, not forgetting to tell me that the only genuine
Chinese tea ever imported into England was to be found in his
shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;With respect to those marks,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;on the bowl and the chests, they are nothing more nor less
than Chinese writing expressing something, though what I
can&rsquo;t exactly tell you.&nbsp; Allow me to sell you this
pound of tea,&rdquo; he added, showing me a paper parcel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;On the envelope there is a printed account of the Chinese
system of writing, extracted from authors of the most established
reputation.&nbsp; These things I print, principally with the hope
of in some degree removing the worse than Gothic ignorance
prevalent amongst the natives of these parts.&nbsp; I am from
London myself.&nbsp; With respect to all that relates to the
Chinese real Imperial tea, I assure you, sir,
that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, to make short of what you
doubtless consider a very tiresome story, I purchased the tea and
carried it home.&nbsp; The tea proved imperially bad, but the
paper envelope really contained some information on the Chinese
language and writing, amounting to about as much as you gained
from me the other day.&nbsp; On learning that the marks on the
teapot expressed words, I felt my interest with respect to them
considerably increased, and returned to the task of inspecting
them with greater zeal than before, hoping, by continually
looking at them, to be able eventually to understand their
meaning, in which hope you may easily believe I was disappointed,
though my desire to understand what they represented continued on
the increase.&nbsp; In this dilemma I determined to apply again
to the shopkeeper from whom I bought the tea.&nbsp; I <!-- page
213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>found him in rather low spirits, his shirt-sleeves were
soiled, and his hair was out of curl.&nbsp; On my inquiring how
he got on, he informed me that he intended speedily to leave,
having received little or no encouragement, the people in their
Gothic ignorance preferring to deal with an old-fashioned
shopkeeper over the way, who, so far from possessing any
acquaintance with the polity and institutions of the Chinese, did
not, he firmly believed, know that tea came from China.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are come for some more, I suppose?&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; On receiving an answer in the negative he looked
somewhat blank, but when I added that I came to consult with him
as to the means which I must take in order to acquire the Chinese
language he brightened up.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must get a
grammar,&rdquo; said he, rubbing his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you
not one?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;but any bookseller can procure you one.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I
was taking my departure he told me that as he was about to leave
the neighbourhood the bowl at the window which bore the
inscription, besides some other pieces of porcelain of a similar
description, were at my service, provided I chose to purchase
them.&nbsp; I consented, and two or three days afterwards took
from off his hands all the china in his possession which bore
inscriptions, paying what he demanded.&nbsp; Had I waited till
the sale of his effects, which occurred within a few weeks, I
could probably have procured it for a fifth part of the sum which
I paid, the other pieces realizing very little.&nbsp; I did not,
however, grudge the poor fellow what he got from me, as I
considered myself to be somewhat in his debt for the information
he had afforded me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for the rest of my story, it may be briefly
told.&nbsp; I followed the advice of the shopkeeper and applied
to a bookseller, who wrote to his correspondent in London.&nbsp;
After a long interval, I was informed that if I wished to learn
Chinese I must do so through the medium of French, there being
neither Chinese grammar nor dictionary in our language.&nbsp; I
was at first very much disheartened.&nbsp; I determined, however,
at last to gratify my desire of learning Chinese, even at the
expense of learning French.&nbsp; I procured the books, and in
order to qualify myself to turn them to account, took lessons in
French from a little Swiss, the usher of a neighbouring
boarding-school.&nbsp; I was very stupid in acquiring French;
perseverance, however, enabled me to acquire a knowledge <!--
page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>sufficient for the object I had in view.&nbsp; In about
two years I began to study Chinese by myself through the medium
of the French.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and how did you get on with
the study of Chinese?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then the old man proceeded to inform me how he got on with
the study of Chinese, enumerating all the difficulties he had had
to encounter, dilating upon his frequent despondency of mind, and
occasionally his utter despair of ever mastering Chinese.&nbsp;
He told me that more than once he had determined upon giving up
the study, but then the misery in his head forthwith returned, to
escape from which he had as often resumed it.&nbsp; It appeared,
however, that ten years elapsed before he was able to use ten of
the two hundred and fourteen keys which serve to undo the locks
of Chinese writing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are you able at present to use the entire
number?&rsquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;I can at present
use the whole number.&nbsp; I know the key for every particular
lock, though I frequently find the words unwilling to give
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has nothing particular occurred to you,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;during the time that you have been prosecuting your
studies?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;During the whole time in which I have been engaged in
these studies,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;only one
circumstance has occurred which requires any particular
mention&mdash;the death of my old friend the surgeon, who was
carried off suddenly by a fit of apoplexy.&nbsp; His death was a
great shock to me, and for a time interrupted my studies.&nbsp;
His son, however, who succeeded him, was very kind to me, and, in
some degree, supplied his father&rsquo;s place; and I gradually
returned to my Chinese locks and keys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in applying keys to the Chinese locks you employ
your time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;in making out the
inscriptions on the various pieces of porcelain, which I have at
different times procured, I pass my time.&nbsp; The first
inscription which I translated was that on the teapot of my
beloved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how many other pieces of porcelain may you have at
present in your possession?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About fifteen hundred.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>&lsquo;And how did you obtain them?&rsquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Without much labour,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;in
the neighbouring towns and villages&mdash;chiefly at
auctions&mdash;of which, about twenty years ago, there were many
in these parts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And may I ask your reasons for confining your studies
entirely to the crockery literature of China, when you have all
the rest at your disposal?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The inscriptions enable me to pass my time,&rsquo; said
the old man; &lsquo;what more would the whole literature of China
do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And from those inscriptions,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what
a book it is in your power to make, whenever so disposed!&nbsp;
&ldquo;Translations from the crockery literature of
China.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a book would be sure to take.&nbsp; Even
glorious John himself would not disdain to publish it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no desire for literary
distinction,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;no ambition.&nbsp; My
original wish was to pass my life in easy, quiet
obscurity&mdash;with her whom I loved.&nbsp; I was disappointed
in my wish; she was removed, who constituted my only felicity in
this life: desolation came to my heart, and misery to my
head.&nbsp; To escape from the latter I had recourse to
Chinese.&nbsp; By degrees the misery left my head, but the
desolation of heart yet remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be of good cheer,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Through
the instrumentality of this affliction you have learnt Chinese,
and, in so doing, learnt to practise the duties of
hospitality.&nbsp; Who but a man who could read Runes on a
teapot, would have received an unfortunate wayfarer as you have
received me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;let us hope that
all is for the best.&nbsp; I am by nature indolent, and, but for
this affliction, should, perhaps, have hardly taken the trouble
to do my duty to my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I am very, very
indolent,&rsquo; said he, slightly glancing towards the clock;
&lsquo;therefore let us hope that all is for the best.&nbsp; But,
oh! these trials, they are very hard to bear.&rsquo;</p>

<p>THE LEAVE-TAKING&mdash;SPIRIT OF THE HEARTH&mdash;WHAT&rsquo;S
O&rsquo;CLOCK</p>
<p>The next morning, having breakfasted with my old friend, I
went into the stable to make the necessary preparations for my
departure; there, with the assistance of a stable lad, I cleaned
and caparisoned my horse, and then, returning into the house, I
made the old female attendant such a present as I deemed would be
some compensation for the trouble I had caused.&nbsp; Hearing
that the old gentleman was in the study, I repaired to him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am come to take leave of you,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and
to thank you for all the hospitality which I have received at
your hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; The eyes of the old man were fixed
steadfastly on the inscription which I had found him studying on
a former occasion.&nbsp; &lsquo;At length,&rsquo; he murmured to
himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have it&mdash;I think I have it;&rsquo;
and then, looking at me, he said: &lsquo;So you are about to
depart?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;my horse will be at the
front door in a few minutes.&nbsp; I am glad, however, before I
go, to find that you have mastered the inscription.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;I believe I have
mastered it.&nbsp; It seems to consist of some verses relating to
the worship of the Spirit of the Hearth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the Spirit of the Hearth?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the many demons which the Chinese
worship,&rsquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;They do not
worship one God, but many.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the old man told
me a great many highly-interesting particulars respecting the
demon worship of the Chinese.</p>
<p>After the lapse of at least half an hour I said: &lsquo;I must
not linger here any longer, however willing.&nbsp; Horncastle is
distant, and I wish to be there to-night.&nbsp; Pray can you
inform me what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man, rising, looked towards the clock which hung on
the side of the room at his left hand, on the farther side of the
table at which he was seated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am rather short-sighted,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and
cannot distinguish the numbers at that distance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is ten o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; said the old man;
&lsquo;I believe somewhat past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A quarter, perhaps?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 217--><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;a quarter,
or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seven minutes, or ten minutes past ten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not understand you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, to tell you the truth,&rsquo; said the old man,
with a smile, &lsquo;there is one thing to the knowledge of which
I could never exactly attain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that you do
not know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can give a guess,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;to
within a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you cannot tell the exact moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the name of wonder,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;with that
thing there on the wall continually ticking in your ear, how
comes it that you do not know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;I have contented
myself with giving a tolerably good guess; to do more would have
been too great trouble.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you have learnt Chinese,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;I have learnt
Chinese.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I really would counsel you
to learn to know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock as soon as
possible.&nbsp; Consider what a sad thing it would be to go out
of the world not knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; A
millionth part of the trouble required to learn Chinese would, if
employed, infallibly teach you to know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a motive for learning Chinese,&rsquo; said the
old man, &lsquo;the hope of appeasing the misery in my
head.&nbsp; With respect to not knowing what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock, I cannot see anything particularly sad in the
matter.&nbsp; A man may get through the world very creditably
without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Yet, upon the
whole, it is no bad thing to know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;you, of course, do?&nbsp; It would be too
good a joke if two people were to be together, one knowing
Armenian and the other Chinese, and neither knowing what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll now see you off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>ARRIVAL AT HORNCASTLE&mdash;THE INN AND OSTLERS&mdash;THE
GARRET&mdash;FIGURE OF A MAN WITH A CANDLE</p>
<p>Leaving the house of the old man who knew Chinese, but could
not tell what was o&rsquo;clock, I wended my way to Horncastle,
which I reached in the evening of the same day, without having
met any adventure on the way worthy of being marked down in this
very remarkable history.</p>
<p>The town was a small one, seemingly ancient, and was crowded
with people and horses.&nbsp; I proceeded, without delay, to the
inn to which my friend the surgeon had directed me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is of no use coming here,&rsquo; said two or three
ostlers, as I entered the yard&mdash;&lsquo;all full&mdash;no
room whatever;&rsquo; whilst one added, in an undertone,
&lsquo;That &rsquo;ere ain&rsquo;t a bad-looking
horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I want to see the master of this
inn,&rsquo; said I, as I dismounted from the horse.&nbsp;
&lsquo;See the master,&rsquo; said an ostler&mdash;the same who
had paid the negative kind of compliment to the
horse&mdash;&lsquo;a likely thing, truly.&nbsp; My master is
drinking wine with some of the grand gentry, and can&rsquo;t be
disturbed for the sake of the like of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
bring a letter to him,&rsquo; said I, pulling out the
surgeon&rsquo;s epistle.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish you would deliver it
to him,&rsquo; I added, offering a half-crown.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s you, is it?&rsquo; said the ostler, taking the letter
and the half-crown.&nbsp; &lsquo;My master will be right glad to
see you.&nbsp; Why you hain&rsquo;t been here for many a long
year.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll carry the note to him at
once.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with these words he hurried into the
house.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a nice horse, young man,&rsquo;
said another ostler.&nbsp; &lsquo;What will you take for
it?&rsquo; to which interrogation I made no answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If you wish to sell him,&rsquo; said the ostler, coming up
to me, and winking knowingly, &lsquo;I think I and my partners
might offer you a summut under seventy pounds;&rsquo; to which
kind of half-insinuated offer I made no reply, save by winking in
the same kind of knowing manner in which I had observed him
wink.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rather leary!&rsquo; said a third
ostler.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, young man, perhaps you will drink
to-night with me and my partners, when we can talk the matter
over.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before I had time to answer, the landlord, a
well-dressed, good-looking man, made his appearance with the
ostler; he bore the letter in his hand.&nbsp; Without glancing at
me, he betook himself <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>at once to consider the horse, going
round him, and observing every point with the utmost
minuteness.&nbsp; At last, after having gone round the horse
three times, he stopped beside me, and keeping his eyes on the
horse, bent his head towards his right shoulder.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That horse is worth some money,&rsquo; said he, turning
towards me suddenly, and slightly touching me on the arm with the
letter which he held in his hand; to which observation I made no
reply, save by bending my head towards the right shoulder as I
had seen him do.&nbsp; &lsquo;The young man is going to talk to
me and my partners about it to-night,&rsquo; said the ostler who
had expressed an opinion that he and his friends might offer me
somewhat under seventy pounds for the animal.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;the young man knows
what he is about; in the meantime lead the horse to the reserved
stall, and see well after him.&nbsp; My friend,&rsquo; said he,
taking me aside after the ostler had led the animal away,
&lsquo;recommends you to me in the strongest manner, on which
account alone I take you and your horse in.&nbsp; I need not
advise you not to be taken in, as I should say, by your look,
that you are tolerably awake; but there are queer hands at
Horncastle at this time, and those fellows of mine, you
understand me&mdash;; but I have a great deal to do at present,
so you must excuse me,&rsquo; and thereupon went into the
house.</p>
<p>That same evening I was engaged at least two hours in the
stable, in rubbing the horse down, and preparing him for the
exhibition which I intended he should make in the fair on the
following day.&nbsp; The ostler, to whom I had given the
half-crown, occasionally assisted me, though he was too much
occupied by the horses of other guests to devote any length of
time to the service of mine; he more than once repeated to me his
firm conviction that himself and partners could afford to offer
me summut for the horse; and at a later hour when, in compliance
with his invitation, I took a glass of summut with himself and
partners, in a little room surrounded with corn-chests, on which
we sat, both himself and partners endeavoured to impress upon me,
chiefly by means of nods and winks, their conviction that they
could afford to give me summut for the horse, provided I were
disposed to sell him; in return for which intimation, with as
many nods and winks as they had all collectively used, I
endeavoured to impress upon them my conviction that I could get
summut <!-- page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>handsomer in the fair than they
might be disposed to offer me, seeing as how&mdash;which how I
followed by a wink and a nod, which they seemed perfectly to
understand, one or two of them declaring that if the case was so,
it made a great deal of difference, and that they did not wish to
be any hindrance to me, more particularly as it was quite clear I
had been an ostler like themselves.</p>
<p>It was late at night when I began to think of retiring to
rest.&nbsp; On inquiring if there was any place in which I could
sleep, I was informed that there was a bed at my service,
provided I chose to sleep in a two-bedded room, one of the beds
of which was engaged by another gentleman.&nbsp; I expressed my
satisfaction at this arrangement, and was conducted by a
maid-servant up many pairs of stairs to a garret, in which were
two small beds, in one of which she gave me to understand another
gentleman slept; he had, however, not yet retired to rest; I
asked who he was, but the maid-servant could give me no
information about him, save that he was a highly respectable
gentleman, and a friend of her master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Presently,
bidding me good night, she left me with a candle; and I, having
undressed myself and extinguished the light, went to bed.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the noises which sounded from every part of the
house, I was not slow in falling asleep, being thoroughly
tired.&nbsp; I know not how long I might have been in bed,
perhaps two hours, when I was partially awakened by a light
shining upon my face, whereupon, unclosing my eyes, I perceived
the figure of a man, with a candle in one hand, staring at my
face, whilst with the other hand he held back the curtain of the
bed.&nbsp; As I have said before, I was only partially awakened,
my power of perception was consequently very confused; it
appeared to me, however, that the man was dressed in a green
coat; that he had curly brown or black hair, and that there was
something peculiar in his look.&nbsp; Just as I was beginning to
recollect myself, the curtain dropped, and I heard, or thought I
heard, a voice say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know the
cove.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then there was a rustling like a person
undressing, whereupon being satisfied that it was my fellow
lodger, I dropped asleep, but was awakened again by a kind of
heavy plunge upon the other bed, which caused it to rock and
creak, when I observed that the light had been extinguished,
probably blown out, if I might judge from a rather disagreeable
smell of burnt <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>wick which remained in the room, and
which kept me awake till I heard my companion breathing hard,
when, turning on the other side, I was again once more speedily
in the arms of slumber.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<p>HORNCASTLE FAIR</p>
<p>It had been my intention to be up and doing early on the
following morning, but my slumbers proved so profound, that I did
not wake until about eight; on arising, I again found myself the
sole occupant of the apartment, my more alert companion having
probably risen at a much earlier hour.&nbsp; Having dressed
myself, I descended, and going to the stable, found my horse
under the hands of my friend the ostler, who was carefully
rubbing him down.&nbsp; &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t a better horse
in the fair,&rsquo; said he to me, &lsquo;and as you are one of
us, and appear to be all right, I&rsquo;ll give you a piece of
advice&mdash;don&rsquo;t take less than a hundred and fifty for
him; if you mind your hits, you may get it, for I have known two
hundred given in this fair for one no better, if so
good.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;thank you
for your advice, which I will take, and, if successful, will give
you &ldquo;summut&rdquo; handsome.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank
you,&rsquo; said the ostler; &lsquo;and now let me ask whether
you are up to all the ways of this here place?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have never been here before,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but I
have a pair of tolerably sharp eyes in my head.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;That I see you have,&rsquo; said the ostler, &lsquo;but
many a body, with as sharp a pair of eyes as yourn, has lost his
horse in this fair, for want of having been here
before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
give you a caution or two.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the ostler
proceeded to give me at least half a dozen cautions, only two of
which I shall relate to the reader: the first, not to stop to
listen to what any chance customer might have to say; and the
last&mdash;the one on which he appeared to lay most
stress&mdash;by no manner of means to permit a Yorkshireman to
get up into the saddle.&nbsp; &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;if you do, it is three to one that he rides off with the
horse.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; Trust a cat amongst
cream, but never trust a Yorkshireman on the saddle of a good
horse.&nbsp; By-the-by,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;that saddle
of yours is not a particularly good one, no more is <!-- page
222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>the bridle.&nbsp; A shabby saddle and a bridle have
more than once spoiled the sale of a good horse.&nbsp; I tell you
what, as you seem a decent kind of a young chap, I&rsquo;ll lend
you a saddle and bridle of my master&rsquo;s, almost bran new; he
won&rsquo;t object I know, as you are a friend of his, only you
must not forget your promise to come down with summut handsome
after you have sold the animal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a slight breakfast I mounted the horse, which, decked
out in his borrowed finery, really looked better by a large sum
of money than on any former occasion.&nbsp; Making my way out of
the yard of the inn, I was instantly in the principal street of
the town, up and down which an immense number of horses were
being exhibited, some led, and others with riders.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
wonderful small quantity of good horses in the fair this
time!&rsquo; I heard a stout jockey-looking individual say, who
was staring up the street with his side towards me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Halloo, young fellow!&rsquo; said he, a few moments after
I had passed, &lsquo;whose horse is that?&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; I
want to look at him!&rsquo;&nbsp; Though confident that he was
addressing himself to me, I took no notice, remembering the
advice of the ostler, and proceeded up the street.&nbsp; My horse
possessed a good walking step; but walking, as the reader knows,
was not his best pace, which was the long trot, at which I could
not well exercise him in the street, on account of the crowd of
men and animals.&nbsp; However, as he walked along, I could
easily perceive that he attracted no slight attention amongst
those who, by their jockey dress and general appearance, I
imagined to be connoisseurs.&nbsp; I heard various calls to stop,
to none of which I paid the slightest attention.&nbsp; In a few
minutes I found myself out of the town, when, turning round for
the purpose of returning, I found I had been followed by several
of the connoisseur-looking individuals, whom I had observed in
the fair.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now would be the time for a
display,&rsquo; thought I; and looking around me I observed two
five-barred gates, one on each side of the road, and fronting
each other.&nbsp; Turning my horse&rsquo;s head to one, I pressed
my heels to his sides, loosened the reins, and gave an
encouraging cry, whereupon the animal cleared the gate in a
twinkling.&nbsp; Before he had advanced ten yards in the field to
which the gate opened, I had turned him round, and again giving
him cry and rein, I caused him to leap back again into the road,
and still allowing <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>him head, I made him leap the other
gate; and forthwith turning him round, I caused him to leap once
more into the road, where he stood proudly tossing his head, as
much as to say, &lsquo;What more?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A fine
horse! a capital horse!&rsquo; said several of the
connoisseurs.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you ask for him?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Too much for any of you to pay,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A horse like this is intended for other kind of customers
than any of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How do you know that?&rsquo;
said one&mdash;the very same person whom I had heard complaining
in the street of the paucity of good horses in the fair.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come, let us know what you ask for him?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;A hundred and fifty pounds!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;neither
more nor less.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you call that a great
price?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I thought you would
have asked double that amount!&nbsp; You do yourself injustice,
young man.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps I do,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;but that&rsquo;s my affair; I do not choose to take
more.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish you would let me get into the
saddle,&rsquo; said the man; &lsquo;the horse knows you, and
therefore shows to more advantage; but I should like to see how
he would move under me, who am a stranger.&nbsp; Will you let me
get into the saddle, young man?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;I will not let you get into the
saddle.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lest you should be a Yorkshireman,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;and should run away with the horse.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yorkshire?&rsquo; said the man; &lsquo;I am from Suffolk;
silly Suffolk&mdash;so you need not be afraid of my running away
with the horse.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! if that&rsquo;s the
case,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I should be afraid that the horse
would run away with you; so I will by no means let you
mount.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Will you let me look in his
mouth?&rsquo; said the man.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you please,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;but I tell you, he&rsquo;s apt to
bite.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He can scarcely be a worse bite than
his master,&rsquo; said the man, looking into the horse&rsquo;s
mouth; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s four off.&nbsp; I say, young man, will
you warrant this horse?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;I never warrant horses; the horses that I ride can always
warrant themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish you would let me
speak a word to you,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just come
aside.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rsquo; said he, in a half
whisper, after I had ridden a few paces aside with him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rsquo; said he, placing his hand
upon the pommel of the saddle, and looking up in my face,
&lsquo;and I think I can find you a customer.&nbsp; If you would
take a hundred, I think my lord would purchase it, for he has
sent me about the fair to look him up a horse, by which he could
hope to make a honest penny.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo;
said I, <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>&lsquo;and could he not make a
honest penny, and yet give me the price I ask?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said the go-between, &lsquo;a hundred and
fifty pounds is as much as the animal is worth, or nearly so; and
my lord, do you see&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I see no reason at
all,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;why I should sell the animal for less
than he is worth, in order that his lordship may be benefited by
him; so that if his lordship wants to make an honest penny, he
must find some person who would consider the disadvantage of
selling him a horse for less than it is worth, as counterbalanced
by the honour of dealing with a lord, which I should never do;
but I can&rsquo;t be wasting my time here.&nbsp; I am going back
to the ---, where if you, or any person, are desirous of
purchasing the horse, you must come within the next half-hour, or
I shall probably not feel disposed to sell him at
all.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Another word, young man,&rsquo; said the
jockey; but without staying to hear what he had to say, I put the
horse to his best trot, and re-entering the town, and threading
my way as well as I could through the press, I returned to the
yard of the inn, where, dismounting, I stood still, holding the
horse by the bridle.</p>
<p>I had been standing in this manner about five minutes, when I
saw the jockey enter the yard, accompanied by another
individual.&nbsp; They advanced directly towards me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here is my lord come to look at the horse, young
man,&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; My lord, <a
name="citation224"></a><a href="#footnote224"
class="citation">[224]</a> as the jockey called him, was a tall
figure of about five-and-thirty.&nbsp; He had on his head a hat
somewhat rusty, and on his back a surtout of blue rather the
worse for wear.&nbsp; His forehead, if not high, was exceedingly
narrow; his eyes were brown, with a rat-like glare in them; the
nose was rather long, and the mouth very wide; the cheek-bones
high, and the cheeks, as to hue and consistency, exhibiting very
much the appearance of a withered red apple; there was a gaunt
expression of hunger in the whole countenance.&nbsp; He had
scarcely glanced at the horse, when drawing in his cheeks, he
thrust out his lips very much after the manner of a baboon, when
he sees a piece of sugar held out towards him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
this horse yours?&rsquo; said he, suddenly turning towards me,
with a kind of smirk.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my horse,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;are you the person who wishes to make a honest
penny by it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How!&rsquo; said he, drawing up
his head with a very consequential look, and speaking <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>with a very haughty tone, &lsquo;what do you
mean?&rsquo;&nbsp; We looked at each other full in the face;
after a few moments the muscles of the mouth of him of the hungry
look began to move violently, the face was puckered into
innumerable wrinkles, and the eyes became half closed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;have you ever seen me
before?&nbsp; I suppose you are asking yourself that
question.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Excuse me, sir,&rsquo; said he,
dropping his lofty look, and speaking in a very subdued and civil
tone, &lsquo;I have never had the honour of seeing you before,
that is&rsquo;&mdash;said he, slightly glancing at me again, and
again moving the muscles of his mouth&mdash;&lsquo;no, I have
never seen you before,&rsquo; he added, making me a low bow,
&lsquo;I have never had that pleasure; my business with you at
present is to inquire the lowest price you are willing to take
for this horse.&nbsp; My agent here informs me that you ask one
hundred and fifty pounds, which I can&rsquo;t think of giving;
the horse is a showy horse, but look, my dear sir, he has a
defect here, and there in his near fore-leg I observe something
which looks very like a splint&mdash;yes, upon my credit,&rsquo;
said he, touching the animal, &lsquo;he has a splint, or
something which will end in one.&nbsp; A hundred and fifty
pounds, sir!&nbsp; What could have induced you ever to ask
anything like that for this animal?&nbsp; I protest that, in my
time, I have frequently bought a better for ---.&nbsp; Who are
you, sir?&nbsp; I am in treaty for this horse,&rsquo; said he to
a man who had come up whilst he was talking, and was now looking
into the horse&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who am I?&rsquo; said
the man, still looking into the horse&rsquo;s
mouth&mdash;&lsquo;who am I? his lordship asks me.&nbsp; Ah, I
see, close on five,&rsquo; said he, releasing the horse&rsquo;s
jaws, and looking at me.&nbsp; This new comer was a thin,
wiry-made individual, with wiry curling brown hair; his face was
dark, and wore an arch and somewhat roguish expression; upon one
of his eyes was a kind of speck or beam; he might be about forty,
wore a green jockey coat, and held in his hand a black
riding-whip, with a knob of silver wire.&nbsp; As I gazed upon
his countenance it brought powerfully to my mind the face which,
by the light of the candle, I had seen staring over me on the
preceding night, when lying in bed and half asleep.&nbsp; Close
beside him, and seemingly in his company, stood an exceedingly
tall figure, that of a youth, seemingly about one-and-twenty,
dressed in a handsome riding-dress, and wearing on his head a
singular hat, green in <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>colour, and
with a very high peak.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you ask for this
horse?&rsquo; said he of the green coat, winking at me with the
eye which had a beam in it, whilst the other shone and sparkled
like Mrs. Colonel W---&rsquo;s Golconda diamond.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who
are you, sir, I demand once more?&rsquo; said he of the hungry
look.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who am I?&nbsp; Why who should I be but Jack
Dale, who buys horses for himself and other folk; I want one at
present for this short young gentleman,&rsquo; said he, motioning
with his finger to the gigantic youth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
sir,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;and what business have you to
interfere between me and any purchase I may be disposed to
make?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said the other,
&lsquo;be quick and purchase the horse, or perhaps I
may.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you think I am to be dictated to by a
fellow of your description?&rsquo; said his lordship;
&lsquo;begone, or&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you ask for
this horse?&rsquo; said the other to me, very coolly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;A hundred and fifty,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind giving it you,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You will do no such thing,&rsquo; said his lordship,
speaking so fast that he almost stuttered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he to me, &lsquo;I must give you what you
ask.&nbsp; Symmonds, take possession of the animal for me,&rsquo;
said he to the other jockey who attended him.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
will please to do no such thing without my consent,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;I have not sold him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have this
moment told you that I will give you the price you demand,&rsquo;
said his lordship, &lsquo;is not that sufficient?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there is a proper manner of
doing everything.&nbsp; Had you come forward in a manly and
gentlemanly manner to purchase the horse, I should have been
happy to sell him to you, but after all the fault you have found
with him, I would not sell him to you at any price, so send your
friend to find up another.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You behave in this
manner, I suppose,&rsquo; said his lordship, &lsquo;because this
fellow has expressed a willingness to come to your terms.&nbsp; I
would advise you to be cautious how you trust the animal in his
hands; I think I have seen him before, and could tell
you&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What can you tell of me?&rsquo;
said the other, going up to him, &lsquo;except that I have been a
poor dicky-boy, <a name="citation226a"></a><a
href="#footnote226a" class="citation">[226a]</a> and that now I
am a dealer in horses, and that my father was lagged? <a
name="citation226b"></a><a href="#footnote226b"
class="citation">[226b]</a> that is all you could tell of me, and
that I don&rsquo;t mind telling myself; but there are two things
they can&rsquo;t say of me, they can&rsquo;t say that I am either
a coward, or a screw either, except so far as one who gets <!--
page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>his bread by horses may be expected to be; and they
can&rsquo;t say of me that I ever ate up an ice which a young
woman was waiting for, or that I ever backed out of a
fight.&nbsp; Horse!&rsquo; said he, motioning with his finger
tauntingly to the other, &lsquo;what do you want with a horse,
except to take the bread out of the mouth of a poor
man&mdash;to-morrow is not the battle of Waterloo, so that you
don&rsquo;t want to back out of danger by pretending to have hurt
yourself by falling from the creature&rsquo;s back, my lord of
the white feather&mdash;come, none of your fierce looks&mdash;I
am not afraid of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; In fact, the other had assumed
an expression of the deadliest malice, his teeth were clenched,
his lips quivered and were quite pale; the rat-like eyes
sparkled, and he made a half spring, &agrave; la rat, towards his
adversary, who only laughed.&nbsp; Restraining himself, however,
he suddenly turned to his understrapper, saying, &lsquo;Symmonds,
will you see me thus insulted?&nbsp; Go and trounce this
scoundrel; you can, I know.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Symmonds trounce
me!&rsquo; said the other, going up to the person addressed, and
drawing his hand contemptuously over his face; &lsquo;why I beat
Symmonds in this very yard in one round three years ago,
didn&rsquo;t I, Symmonds?&rsquo; said he to the understrapper,
who held down his head, muttering in a surly tone, &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t come here to fight; let every one take his own
part.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, Symmonds,&rsquo;
said the other, &lsquo;especially every one from whom there is
nothing to be got.&nbsp; I would give you half-a crown for all
the trouble you have had, provided I were not afraid that my Lord
Plume there would get it from you as soon as you leave the yard
together.&nbsp; Come, take yourselves both off; there&rsquo;s
nothing to be made here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Indeed, his lordship seemed
to be of the same opinion, for after a further glance at the
horse, a contemptuous look at me, and a scowl at the jockey, he
turned on his heel, muttering something which sounded like
fellows, and stalked out of the yard, followed by Symmonds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, young man,&rsquo; said the jockey, or whatever
he was, turning to me with an arch leer, &lsquo;I suppose I may
consider myself as the purchaser of this here animal, for the use
and behoof of this young gentleman,&rsquo; making a sign with his
head towards the tall young man by his side.&nbsp; &lsquo;By no
means,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I am utterly unacquainted with
either of you, and before parting with the horse I must be
satisfied as to the respectability of the purchaser.&rsquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>&lsquo;Oh! as to that matter,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I
have plenty of vouchers for my respectability about me;&rsquo;
and, thrusting his hand into his bosom below his waistcoat, he
drew out a large bundle of notes.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are the kind
of things,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;which vouch best for a
man&rsquo;s respectability.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not
always,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;indeed, sometimes these kind of
things need vouchers for themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; The man looked
at me with a peculiar look.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you mean to say that
these notes are not sufficient notes?&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;because if you do I shall take the liberty of thinking
that you are not over civil, and when I thinks a person is not
over and above civil I sometimes takes off my coat; and when my
coat is off&mdash;.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You sometimes knock
people down,&rsquo; I added; &lsquo;well, whether you knock me
down or not, I beg leave to tell you that I am a stranger in this
fair, and that I shall part with the horse to nobody who has no
better guarantee for his respectability than a roll of
bank-notes, which may be good or not for what I know, who am not
a judge of such things.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! if you are a
stranger here,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;as I believe you are,
never having seen you here before except last night, when I think
I saw you above stairs by the glimmer of a candle&mdash;I say, if
you are a stranger, you are quite right to be cautious; queer
things being done in this fair, as nobody knows better than
myself,&rsquo; he added, with a leer; &lsquo;but I suppose if the
landlord of the house vouches for me and my notes, you will have
no objection to part with the horse to me?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;None whatever,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and in the meantime
the horse can return to the stable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I delivered the horse to my friend the ostler.&nbsp;
The landlord of the house, on being questioned by me as to the
character and condition of my new acquaintance, informed me that
he was a respectable horsedealer, and an intimate friend of his,
whereupon the purchase was soon brought to a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<p>HIGH DUTCH</p>
<p>It was evening: and myself and the two acquaintances I had
made in the fair&mdash;namely, the jockey and the tall
foreigner&mdash;sat in a large upstairs room, which looked into a
court; we had dined with several people connected <!-- page
229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>with the fair at a long table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te; they
had now departed, and we sat at a small side-table with wine and
a candle before us; both my companions had pipes in their
mouths&mdash;the jockey a common pipe, and the foreigner, one,
the syphon of which made of some kind of wood, was at least six
feet long, and the bowl of which, made of a white kind of
substance like porcelain, and capable of holding nearly an ounce
of tobacco, rested on the ground.&nbsp; The jockey frequently
emptied and replenished his glass; the foreigner sometimes raised
his to his lips, for no other purpose seemingly than to moisten
them, as he never drained his glass.&nbsp; As for myself, though
I did not smoke, I had a glass before me, from which I sometimes
took a sip.&nbsp; The room, notwithstanding the window was flung
open, was in general so filled with smoke, chiefly that which was
drawn from the huge bowl of the foreigner, that my companions and
I were frequently concealed from each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
The conversation, which related entirely to the events of the
fair, was carried on by the jockey and myself, the foreigner, who
appeared to understand the greater part of what we said,
occasionally putting in a few observations in broken
English.&nbsp; At length the jockey, after the other had made
some ineffectual attempts to express something intelligibly which
he wished to say, observed: &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity that so
fine a fellow as meinheer, and so clever a fellow too, as I
believe him to be, is not a little better master of our
language?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the gentleman a German?&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;if so
I can interpret for him anything he wishes to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The deuce you can,&rsquo; said the jockey, taking his
pipe out of his mouth, and staring at me through the smoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha! you speak German,&rsquo; vociferated the foreigner
in that language.&nbsp; &lsquo;By Isten, I am glad of it!&nbsp; I
wanted to say&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; And here he said in German what
he wished to say, and which was of no great importance, and which
I translated into English.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t put me out,&rsquo; said the
jockey; &lsquo;what language is that&mdash;Dutch?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High Dutch,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;High Dutch, and you speak High Dutch; why I had booked
you for as great an ignoramus as myself, who can&rsquo;t
write&mdash;no, nor distinguish in a book a great A from a
bull&rsquo;s foot.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&lsquo;A person may be a very clever man,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;no, not a clever man, for clever signifies clerkly, and
a clever man one who is able to read and write, and entitled to
the benefit of his clergy or clerkship; but a person may be a
very acute person without being able to read or write.&nbsp; I
never saw a more acute countenance than your own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No soft soap,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;for I
never uses any.&nbsp; However, thank you for your information; I
have hitherto thought myself a &rsquo;nition clever fellow, but
from henceforth shall consider myself just the contrary, and
only&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&mdash;confounded
&rsquo;cute.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;as you say you can
speak High Dutch, I should like to hear you and master six foot
six fire away at each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot speak German,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but I can
understand tolerably well what others say in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, no backing out,&rsquo; said the jockey,
&lsquo;let&rsquo;s hear you fire away for the glory of Old
England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are a German?&rsquo; said I, in German, to the
foreigner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;keep it
up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A German!&rsquo; said the tall foreigner.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No, I thank God that I do not belong to the stupid
sluggish Germanic race, but to a braver, taller, and handsomer
people;&rsquo; here taking the pipe out of his mouth, he stood up
proudly erect, so that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the
room, then reseating himself, and again putting the syphon to his
lips, he added, &lsquo;I am a Magyar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>The foreigner looked at me for a moment, somewhat
contemptuously, through the smoke, then said, in a voice of
thunder: &lsquo;A Hungarian!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a voice the chap has when he pleases!&rsquo;
interposed the jockey; &lsquo;what is he saying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merely that he is a Hungarian,&rsquo; said I, but I
added, &lsquo;the conversation of this gentleman and myself in a
language which you can&rsquo;t understand must be very tedious to
you, we had better give it up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep on with it,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;I shall
go on listening very contentedly till I fall asleep, no bad thing
to do at most times.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<p>THE HUNGARIAN <a name="citation231"></a><a href="#footnote231"
class="citation">[231]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you are a countryman of Tekeli, and of the queen
who made the celebrated water,&rsquo; said I, speaking to the
Hungarian in German, which I was able to do tolerably well, owing
to my having translated the Publisher&rsquo;s philosophy into
that language, always provided I did not attempt to say much at a
time.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Ah! you have heard of Tekeli, and of
L&rsquo;eau de la Reine d&rsquo;Hongrie.&nbsp; How is that?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have seen a play acted, founded on the
exploits of Tekeli, and have read Pigault Le Brun&rsquo;s
beautiful romance, entitled the &lsquo;Barons of Felsheim,&rsquo;
in which he is mentioned.&nbsp; As for the water, I have heard a
lady, the wife of a master of mine, speak of it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was she handsome?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Very.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Did she possess the water?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I should say not; for I have heard her
express a great curiosity about it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was she growing old?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of course not; but why do you put all
these questions?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Because the water is said to make
people handsome, and, above all, to restore to the aged the
beauty of their youth.&nbsp; Well!&nbsp; Tekeli was my
countryman, and I have the honour of having some of the blood of
the Tekelis in my veins, but with respect to the queen, pardon me
if I tell you that she was not a Hungarian; she was a
Pole&mdash;Ersebet by name, daughter of Vladislaus Locticus, King
of Poland; she was the fourth spouse of Caroly the Second, King
of the Magyar country, who married her in the year 1320.&nbsp;
She was a great woman and celebrated politician, though at
present chiefly known by her water.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How came she to invent it?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; If her own account may be believed,
she did not invent it.&nbsp; After her death, as I have read in
Florentius of Buda, there was found a statement of the manner in
which she came by it, written in her own hand, <!-- page 232--><a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>on a
fly-leaf of her breviary, to the following effect: Being
afflicted with a grievous disorder at the age of seventy-two, she
received the medicine which was called her water, from an old
hermit whom she never saw before or afterwards; it not only cured
her, but restored to her all her former beauty, so that the King
of Poland fell in love with her, and made her an offer of
marriage, which she refused for the glory of God, from whose holy
angel she believed she had received the water.&nbsp; The receipt
for making it and directions for using it, were also found on the
fly-leaf.&nbsp; The principal component parts were burnt wine and
rosemary, passed through an alembic; a drachm of it was to be
taken once a week, &lsquo;etelbenn vagy italbann,&rsquo; in the
food or the drink, early in the morning, and the cheeks were to
be moistened with it every day.&nbsp; The effects, according to
the statement, were wonderful&mdash;and perhaps they were upon
the queen; but whether the water has been equally efficacious on
other people, is a point which I cannot determine.&nbsp; I should
wish to see some old woman who has been restored to youthful
beauty by the use of L&rsquo;eau de la Reine d&rsquo;Hongrie.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps, if you did, the old gentlewoman
would hardly be so ingenuous as the queen.&nbsp; But who are the
Hungarians&mdash;descendants of Attila and his people?</p>
<p>The Hungarian shook his head, and gave me to understand that
he did not believe that his nation were the descendants of Attila
and his people, though he acknowledged that they were probably of
the same race.&nbsp; Attila and his armies, he said, came and
disappeared in a very mysterious manner, and that nothing could
be said with positiveness about them; that the people now known
as Magyars first made their appearance in Muscovy in the year
884, under the leadership of Almus, called so from Alom, which,
in the Hungarian language, signifies a dream; his mother, before
his birth, having dreamt that the child with which she was
enceinte would be the father of a long succession of kings,
which, in fact, was the case; that after beating the Russians he
entered Hungary, and coming to a place called Ungvar, from which
many people believed that modern Hungary derived its name, he
captured it, and held in it a grand festival, which lasted four
days, at the end of which time he resigned the leadership of the
Magyars to his son Arpad.&nbsp; This Arpad and his Magyars
utterly subdued Pannonia&mdash;that is, Hungary <!-- page
233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>and Transylvania, wresting the government of it from
the Sclavonian tribes who inhabited it, and settling down amongst
them as conquerors!&nbsp; After giving me this information, the
Hungarian exclaimed with much animation: &lsquo;A goodly country
that which they had entered on, consisting of a plain surrounded
by mountains, some of which intersect it here and there, with
noble rapid rivers, the grandest of which is the mighty Dunau; a
country with tiny volcanoes, casting up puffs of smoke and steam,
and from which hot springs arise, good for the sick; with many
fountains, some of which are so pleasant to the taste as to be
preferred to wine; with a generous soil which, warmed by a
beautiful sun, is able to produce corn, grapes, and even the
Indian weed; in fact, one of the finest countries in the world,
which even a Spaniard would pronounce to be nearly equal to
Spain.&nbsp; Here they rested&mdash;meditating, however, fresh
conquests.&nbsp; Oh, the Magyars soon showed themselves a mighty
people.&nbsp; Besides Hungary and Transylvania, they subdued
Bulgaria and Bosnia, and the land of Tot, now called
Sclavonia.&nbsp; The generals of Zoltan, the son of Arpad, led
troops of horsemen to the banks of the Rhine.&nbsp; One of them,
at the head of a host, besieged Constantinople.&nbsp; It was then
that Botond engaged in combat with a Greek of gigantic stature,
who came out of the city and challenged the two best men in the
Magyar army.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the feeblest of the
Magyars,&rdquo; said Botond, &ldquo;but I will kill thee;&rdquo;
and he performed his word, having previously given a proof of the
feebleness of his arm by striking his battle-axe through the
brazen gate, making a hole so big that a child of five years old
could walk through it.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of what religion were the old
Hungarians?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They had some idea of a Supreme Being,
whom they called Isten, which word is still used by the Magyars
for God; but their chief devotion was directed to sorcerers and
soothsayers, something like the Schamans of the Siberian
steppes.&nbsp; They were converted to Christianity chiefly
through the instrumentality of Istvan or Stephen, called after
his death St. Istvan, who ascended the throne in the year one
thousand.&nbsp; He was born in heathenesse, and his original name
was Vojk: he was the first kiraly, or king of the Magyars.&nbsp;
Their former leaders had been called fejedelmek, or dukes.&nbsp;
The Magyar language has properly no term either for king or <!--
page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>house.&nbsp; Kiraly is a word derived from the Sclaves;
haz, or house, from the Germans, who first taught them to build
houses, their original dwellings having been tilted waggons.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Many thanks for your account of the great
men of your country.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; The great men of my country!&nbsp; I
have only told you of the&mdash;.&nbsp; Well, I acknowledge that
Almus and Arpad were great men, but Hungary has produced many
greater; I will not trouble you by recapitulating all, but there
is one name I cannot forbear mentioning&mdash;but you have heard
it&mdash;even at Horncastle, the name of Hunyadi must be
familiar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It may be so, though I rather doubt it;
but, however that may be, I confess my ignorance.&nbsp; I have
never, until this moment, heard of the name of Hunyadi.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Not of Hunyadi Janos, not of Hunyadi
John&mdash;for the genius of our language compels us to put a
man&rsquo;s Christian name after his other; perhaps you have
heard of the name of Corvinus?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I have heard of the name of
Corvinus.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; By my God, I am glad of it; I thought
our hammer of destruction, our thunderbolt, whom the Greeks
called Achilles, must be known to the people of Horncastle.&nbsp;
Well, Hunyadi and Corvinus are the same.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Corvinus means the man of the crow, or
raven.&nbsp; I suppose that your John, when a boy, climbed up to
a crow or raven&rsquo;s nest, and stole the young; a bold feat,
well befitting a young hero.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; By Isten, you are an acute guesser, a
robbery there was, but it was not Hunyadi who robbed the raven,
but the raven who robbed Hunyadi.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How was that?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; In this manner: Hunyadi, according to
tradition, was the son of King Sigmond, by a peasant&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; The king saw and fell in love with her, whilst
marching against the vaivode of Wallachia.&nbsp; He had some
difficulty in persuading her to consent to his wishes, and she
only yielded at last, on the king making her a solemn promise
that, in the event of her becoming with child by him, he would
handsomely provide for her and the infant.&nbsp; The king
proceeded on his expedition; and on his returning in triumph from
Wallachia, again saw the girl, who informed him that she was
enceinte by him; <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>the king was delighted with the
intelligence, gave the girl money, and at the same time a ring,
requesting her, if she brought forth a son, to bring the ring to
Buda with the child, and present it to him.&nbsp; When her time
was up, the peasant&rsquo;s daughter brought forth a fair son,
who was baptized by the name of John.&nbsp; After some time the
young woman communicated the whole affair to her elder brother,
whose name was Gaspar, and begged him to convey her and the child
to the king at Buda.&nbsp; The brother consented, and both set
out, taking the child with them.&nbsp; On their way, the woman,
wanting to wash her clothes, laid the child down, giving it the
king&rsquo;s ring to play with.&nbsp; A raven, who saw the
glittering ring, came flying, and plucking it out of the
child&rsquo;s hand, carried it up into a tree; the child suddenly
began to cry, and the mother, hearing it, left her washing, and
running to the child, forthwith missed the ring, but hearing the
raven croak in the tree, she lifted up her eyes, and saw it with
the ring in its beak.&nbsp; The woman, in great terror, called
her brother, and told him what had happened, adding, that she
durst not approach the king if the raven took away the
ring.&nbsp; Gaspar, seizing his cross-bow and quiver, ran to the
tree, where the raven was yet with the ring, and discharged an
arrow at it, but, being in a great hurry, he missed it; with his
second shot he was more lucky, for he hit the raven in the
breast, which, together with the ring, fell to the ground.&nbsp;
Taking up the ring, they went on their way, and shortly arrived
at Buda.&nbsp; One day, as the king was walking after dinner in
his outer hall, the woman appeared before him with the child,
and, showing him the ring, said, &lsquo;Mighty lord! behold this
token! and take pity upon me and your own son.&rsquo;&nbsp; King
Sigmond took the child and kissed it, and, after a pause, said to
the mother, &lsquo;You have done right in bringing me the boy; I
will take care of you, and make him a nobleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
king was as good as his word, he provided for the mother, caused
the boy to be instructed in knightly exercises, and made him a
present of the town of Hunyad, in Transylvania, on which account
he was afterwards called Hunyadi, and gave him, as an armorial
sign, a raven bearing a ring in his beak.</p>
<p>Such, O young man of Horncastle! is the popular account of the
birth of the great captain of Hungary, as related by Florentius
of Buda.&nbsp; There are other accounts <!-- page 236--><a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>of his
birth, which is, indeed, involved in much mystery, and of the
reason of his being called Corvinus, but as this is the most
pleasing, and is, upon the whole, founded on quite as good
evidence as the others, I have selected it for recitation.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I heartily thank you, but you must tell
me something more of Hunyadi.&nbsp; You call him your great
captain; what did he do?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Do! what no other man of his day could
have done.&nbsp; He broke the power of the Turk when he was
coming to overwhelm Europe.&nbsp; From the blows inflicted by
Hunyadi, the Turk never thoroughly recovered; he has been
frequently worsted in latter times, but none but Hunyadi could
have routed the armies of Amurath and Mahomed the Second.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How was it that he had an opportunity of
displaying his military genius?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I can hardly tell you, but his valour
soon made him famous; King Albert made him Ban of Szorenyi.&nbsp;
He became eventually waivode of Transylvania, and Governor of
Hungary.&nbsp; His first grand action was the defeat of the
Bashaw Isack; and though himself surprised and routed at St.
Imre, he speedily regained his prestige by defeating the Turks,
with enormous slaughter, killing their leader, Mezerbeg: and
subsequently, at the Battle of the Iron Gates, he destroyed
ninety thousand Turks, sent by Amurath to avenge the late
disgrace.&nbsp; It was then that the Greeks called him
Achilles.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; He was not always successful.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Who could be always successful against
the early Turk?&nbsp; He was defeated in the battle in which King
Vladislaus lost his life, but his victories outnumbered his
defeats threefold.&nbsp; His grandest victory&mdash;perhaps the
grandest ever achieved by man&mdash;was over the terrible Mahomed
the Second, who, after the taking of Constantinople in 1453,
said, &lsquo;One God in Heaven&mdash;one king on earth;&rsquo;
and marched to besiege Belgrade at the head of one hundred and
fifty thousand men; swearing, by the beard of the prophet,
&lsquo;That he would sup within it ere two months were
elapsed.&rsquo;&nbsp; He brought with him dogs to eat the bodies
of the Christians whom he should take or slay&mdash;so says
Florentius.&nbsp; Hear what he also says: The Turk sat down
before the town towards <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>the end of
June, 1454, covering the Dunau and Szava with ships; and on the
4th of July he began to cannonade Belgrade with canons
twenty-five feet long, whose roar could be heard at Szeged, a
distance of twenty-four leagues, at which place Hunyadi had
assembled his forces.&nbsp; Hunyadi had been able to raise only
fifteen thousand of well-armed and disciplined men, though he had
with him vast bands of people, who called themselves Soldiers of
the Cross, but who consisted of inexperienced lads from school,
peasants, and hermits, armed with swords, slings, and
clubs.&nbsp; Hunyadi, undismayed by the great disparity between
his forces and those of the Turk, advanced to relieve Belgrade,
and encamped at Szalankemen with his army.&nbsp; There he saw at
once, that his first step must be to attack the flotilla; he
therefore privately informed Szilagy, his wife&rsquo;s brother,
who at that time defended Belgrade, that it was his intention to
attack the ships of the Turks on the 14th day of July in front,
and requested his co-operation in the rear.&nbsp; On the 14th
came on the commencement of the great battle of Belgrade, between
Hunyadi and the Turk.&nbsp; Many days it lasted.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Describe it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I cannot.&nbsp; One has described it
well&mdash;Florentius, of Buda.&nbsp; I can only repeat a few of
his words: &lsquo;On the appointed day, Hunyadi, with two hundred
vessels, attacked the Turkish flotilla in front, whilst Szilagy,
with forty vessels, filled with the men of Belgrade, assailed it
in the rear; striving for the same object, they sunk many of the
Turkish vessels, captured seventy-four, burnt many, and utterly
annihilated the whole fleet.&nbsp; After this victory, Hunyadi,
with his army, entered Belgrade, to the great joy of the
Magyars.&nbsp; But though the force of Mahomed upon the water was
destroyed, that upon the land remained entire; and with this,
during six days and nights, he attacked the city without
intermission, destroying its walls in many parts.&nbsp; His last
and most desperate assault was made on the 21st day of
July.&nbsp; Twice did the Turks gain possession of the outer
town, and twice was it retaken with indescribable
slaughter.&nbsp; The next day the combat raged without ceasing
till mid-day, when the Turks were again beaten out of the town,
and pursued by the Magyars to their camp.&nbsp; There the combat
was renewed, both sides <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>displaying
the greatest obstinacy, until Mahomed received a great wound over
his left eye.&nbsp; The Turks then, turning their faces, fled,
leaving behind them three hundred cannon in the hands of the
Christians, and more than twenty-four thousand slain on the field
of battle.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; After that battle, I suppose Hunyadi
enjoyed his triumphs in peace?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; In the deepest, for he shortly
died.&nbsp; His great soul quitted his body, which was exhausted
by almost superhuman exertions, on the 11th of August,
1456.&nbsp; Shortly before he died, according to Florentius, a
comet appeared, sent, as it would seem, to announce his coming
end.&nbsp; The whole Christian world mourned his loss.&nbsp; The
Pope ordered the cardinals to perform a funeral ceremony at Rome
in his honour.&nbsp; His great enemy himself grieved for him, and
pronounced his finest eulogium.&nbsp; When Mahomed the Second
heard of his death, he struck his head for some time against the
ground without speaking.&nbsp; Suddenly he broke silence with
these words, &lsquo;Notwithstanding he was my enemy, yet do I
bewail his loss; since the sun has shone in heaven, no Prince had
ever yet such a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What was the name of his Prince?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Laszlo the Fifth; who, though under
infinite obligations to Hunyadi, was anything but grateful to
him; for he once consented to a plan which was laid to
assassinate him, contrived by his mortal enemy Ulrik, Count of
Cilejia; and after Hunyadi&rsquo;s death, caused his eldest son,
Hunyadi Laszlo, to be executed on a false accusation, and
imprisoned his younger son, Matyas, who, on the death of Laszlo,
was elected by the Magyars to be their king, on the 24th of
January, 1458.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Was this Matyas a good king?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was Matyas Corvinus a good king?&nbsp;
O young man of Horncastle! he was the best and greatest that
Hungary ever possessed, and, after his father, the most renowned
warrior&mdash;some of our best laws were framed by him.&nbsp; It
was he who organized the Hussar force, and it was he who took
Vienna.&nbsp; Why does your Government always send fools to
represent it at Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I really cannot say; but with respect to
the Hussar force, is it of Hungarian origin?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Its name shows its origin.&nbsp; Huz,
in Hungarian, is twenty, and the Hussar force is so called
because <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>it is formed of twentieths.&nbsp; A
law was issued, by which it was ordered that every Hungarian
nobleman, out of every twenty dependants, should produce a
well-equipped horseman, and with him proceed to the field of
battle.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why did Matyas capture Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Because the Emperor Frederick took
part against him with the King of Poland, who claimed the kingdom
of Hungary for his son, and had also assisted the Turk.&nbsp; He
captured it in the year 1487, but did not survive his triumph
long, expiring there in the year 1490.&nbsp; He was so veracious
a man, that it was said of him, after his death, &lsquo;Truth
died with Matyas.&rsquo;&nbsp; It might be added, that the glory
of Hungary departed with him.&nbsp; I wish to say nothing more
connected with Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Another word.&nbsp; Did Matyas leave a
son?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A natural son, Hunyadi John, called so
after the great man.&nbsp; He would have been universally
acknowledged as King of Hungary but for the illegitimacy of his
birth.&nbsp; As it was, Ulaszlo, the son of the King of Poland,
afterwards called Ulaszlo the Second, who claimed Hungary as
being descended from Albert, was nominated king by a great
majority of the Magyar electors.&nbsp; Hunyadi John for some time
disputed the throne with him; there was some bloodshed, but
Hunyadi John eventually submitted, and became the faithful
captain of Ulaszlo, notwithstanding that the Turk offered to
assist him with an army of two hundred thousand men.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Go on.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; To what?&nbsp; Tch&eacute; Drak, to
the Mohacs Veszedelem.&nbsp; Ulaszlo left a son, Lajos the
Second, born without skin, as it is said, certainly without a
head.&nbsp; He, contrary to the advice of all his wise
counsellors&mdash;and amongst them was Batory Stephen, who became
eventually King of Poland&mdash;engaged, with twenty-five
thousand men, at Mohacs, Soliman the Turk, who had an army of two
hundred thousand.&nbsp; Drak! the Magyars were annihilated, King
Lajos disappeared with his heavy horse and armour in a bog.&nbsp;
We call that battle, which was fought on the 29th of August,
1526, the destruction of Mohacs, but it was the destruction of
Hungary.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have twice used the word drak, what
is the meaning of it?&nbsp; Is it Hungarian?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; No! it belongs to the Mad
Wallacks.&nbsp; They <!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>are a nation of madmen on the other
side of Transylvania.&nbsp; Their country was formerly a fief of
Hungary, like Moldavia, which is inhabited by the same race, who
speak the same language, and are equally mad.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What language do they speak?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A strange mixture of Latin and
Sclavonian&mdash;they themselves being a mixed race of Romans and
Sclavonians.&nbsp; Trajan sent certain legions to form military
colonies in Dacia; and the present Wallacks and Moldavians are,
to a certain extent, the descendants of the Roman soldiers, who
married the women of the country, I say to a certain extent, for
the Sclavonian element both in blood and language, seems to
prevail.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And what is drak?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Dragon; which the Wallacks use for
devil.&nbsp; The term is curious, as it shows that the old Romans
looked upon the dragon as an infernal being.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have been in Wallachia?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I have, and glad I was to get out of
it.&nbsp; I hate the mad Wallacks.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why do you call them mad?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They are always drinking or
talking.&nbsp; I never saw a Wallachian eating or silent.&nbsp;
They talk like madmen, and drink like madmen.&nbsp; In drinking
they use small phials, the contents of which they pour down their
throats.&nbsp; When I first went amongst them I thought the whole
nation was under a course of physic, but the terrible jabber of
their tongues soon undeceived me.&nbsp; Drak was the first word I
heard on entering Dacia, and the last when I left it.&nbsp; The
Moldaves, if possible, drink more, and talk more than the
Wallachians.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It is singular enough that the only
Moldavian I have known could not speak.&nbsp; I suppose he was
born dumb.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A Moldavian born dumb!&nbsp; Excuse
me, the thing is impossible; all Moldavians are born
talking!&nbsp; I have known a Moldavian who could not speak, but
he was not born dumb.&nbsp; His master, an Armenian, snipped off
part of his tongue at Adrianople.&nbsp; He drove him mad with his
jabber.&nbsp; He is now in London, where his master has a
house.&nbsp; I have letters of credit on the house: the clerk
paid me money in London, the master was absent; the money which
you received for the horse belonged to that house.</p>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Another word with respect to
Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Drak!&nbsp; I wish to say nothing more
about Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The Turk, I suppose, after Mohacs, got
possession of Hungary?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; The Turk, upon the
whole, showed great moderation; not so the Austrian.&nbsp;
Ferdinand the First claimed the crown of Hungary as being the
cousin of Maria, widow of Lajos; he found too many disposed to
support him.&nbsp; His claim, however, was resisted by Zapolya
John, a Hungarian magnate, who caused himself to be elected
King.&nbsp; Hungary was for a long time devastated by the wars
between the partisans of Zapolya and Ferdinand.&nbsp; At last
Zapolya called in the Turk.&nbsp; Soliman behaved generously to
him, and after his death befriended his young son, and Isabella
his Queen.&nbsp; Eventually the Turks became masters of
Transylvania and the greater part of Hungary.&nbsp; They were not
bad masters, and had many friends in Hungary, especially amongst
those of the reformed faith, to which I have myself the honour of
belonging; those of the reformed faith found the Mufti more
tolerant than the Pope.&nbsp; Many Hungarians went with the Turks
to the siege of Vienna, whilst Tekeli and his horsemen guarded
Hungary for them.&nbsp; A gallant enterprise, that siege of
Vienna&mdash;the last great effort of the Turk.&nbsp; It failed,
and he speedily lost Hungary, but he did not sneak from Hungary
like a frightened hound.&nbsp; His defence of Buda will not be
soon forgotten, where Apty Basha, the governor, died fighting
like a lion in the breach.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a Hungarian
would prefer Stamboul to Vienna.&nbsp; Why does your Government
always send fools to represent it at Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have already told you that I cannot
say.&nbsp; What became of Tekeli?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; When Hungary was lost he retired with
the Turks into Turkey.&nbsp; Count Renoncourt, in his Memoirs,
mentions having seen him at Adrianople.&nbsp; The Sultan, in
consideration of the services which he had rendered to the Moslem
in Hungary, made over the revenues of certain towns and districts
for his subsistence.&nbsp; The count says that he always went
armed to the teeth, and was always attended by a young female
dressed in male attire, who had followed him in his wars, <!--
page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>and had more than once saved his life.&nbsp; His end is
wrapped in mystery, I&mdash;whose greatest boast, next to being a
Hungarian, is to be of his blood&mdash;know nothing of his
end.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Allow me to ask who you are.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Egy szegeny Magyar Nemes ember, a poor
Hungarian nobleman, son of one yet poorer.&nbsp; I was born in
Transylvania, not far to the west of good Coloscvar.&nbsp; I
served some time in the Austrian army as a noble Hussar, but am
now equerry to a great nobleman, to whom I am distantly
related.&nbsp; In his service I have travelled far and wide,
buying horses.&nbsp; I have been in Russia and Turkey, and am now
at Horncastle, where I have had the satisfaction to meet with
you, and to buy your horse, which is, in truth, a noble
brute.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; For a soldier and equerry you seem to
know a great deal of the history of your country.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; All I know is derived from Florentius
of Buda, whom we call Budai Ferentz.&nbsp; He was professor of
Greek and Latin at the Reformed College of Debreczen, where I was
educated; he wrote a work entitled &lsquo;Magyar Polgari
Lexicon,&rsquo; Lives of Great Hungarian Citizens.&nbsp; He was
dead before I was born, but I found his book, when I was a child,
in the solitary home of my father, which stood on the confines of
a puszta, or wilderness, and that book I used to devour in winter
nights when the winds were whistling around the house.&nbsp; Oh!
how my blood used to glow at the descriptions of Magyar valour,
and likewise of Turkish; for Florentius has always done justice
to the Turk.&nbsp; Many a passage similar to this have I got by
heart; it is connected with the battle on the plain of Rigo,
which Hunyadi lost: &lsquo;The next day, which was Friday, as the
two armies were drawn up in battle array, a Magyar hero, riding
forth, galloped up and down, challenging the Turks to single
combat.&nbsp; Then came out to meet him the son of a renowned
bashaw of Asia.&nbsp; Rushing upon each other, both broke their
lances, but the Magyar hero and his horse rolled over upon the
ground, for the Turks had always the best horses.&rsquo;&nbsp; O
young man of Horncastle! if ever you learn Hungarian&mdash;and
learn it assuredly you will after what I have told you&mdash;read
the book of Florentius of Buda, even if you go to Hungary to get
it, for you will scarcely find it elsewhere, and even there with
difficulty, for the book has <!-- page 243--><a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>been long
out of print.&nbsp; It describes the actions of the great men of
Hungary down to the middle of the sixteenth century, and besides
being written in the purest Hungarian, has the merit of having
for its author a professor of the Reformed College at
Debreczen.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I will go to Hungary rather than not read
it.&nbsp; I am glad that the Turk beat the Magyar.&nbsp; When I
used to read the ballads of Spain I always sided with the Moor
against the Christian.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; It was a drawn fight after all, for
the terrible horse of the Turk presently flung his own master,
whereupon the two champions returned to their respective armies;
but in the grand conflict which ensued the Turks beat the
Magyars, pursuing them till night, and striking them on the necks
with their scymetars.&nbsp; The Turk is a noble fellow; I should
wish to be a Turk, were I not a Magyar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The Turk always keeps his word, I am
told.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Which the Christian very seldom does,
and even the Hungarian does not always.&nbsp; In 1444 Ulaszlo
made, at Szeged, peace with Amurath for ten years, which he swore
with an oath to keep, but at the instigation of the Pope Julian
he broke it, and induced his great captain, Hunyadi John, to
share in the perjury.&nbsp; The consequence was the Battle of
Varna, of the 10th of November, in which Hunyadi was routed, and
Ulaszlo slain.&nbsp; Did you ever hear his epitaph?&nbsp; It is
both solemn and edifying:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Romulid&aelig; Cannas ego Varnam clade
notavi;<br />
Discite mortales non temerare fidem:<br />
Me nisi Pontifices jussissent rumpere f&oelig;dus<br />
Non ferret Scythicum Pannonis ora jugum.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Halloo!&rsquo; said the jockey, starting up from a doze
in which he had been indulging for the last hour, his head
leaning upon his breast; &lsquo;what is that?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
not high Dutch; I bargained for high Dutch, and I left you
speaking what I believed to be high Dutch, as it sounded very
much like the language of horses, as I have been told high Dutch
does; but as for what you are speaking now, whatever you may call
it, it sounds more like the language of another kind of
animal.&nbsp; I suppose you want to insult me because I was once
a dicky-boy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing of the kind,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
gentleman was making a quotation in Latin.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&lsquo;Latin, was it?&rsquo; said the jockey;
&lsquo;that alters the case.&nbsp; Latin is genteel, and I have
sent my eldest boy to an academy to learn it.&nbsp; Come, let us
hear you fire away in Latin,&rsquo; he continued, proceeding to
re-light his pipe, which before going to sleep he had laid on the
table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you wish to follow the discourse in Latin,&rsquo;
said the Hungarian, in very bad English, &lsquo;I can oblige you;
I learned to speak very good Latin in the College of
Debreczen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s more,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;than I have
done in the colleges where I have been; in any little
conversation which we may yet have I wish you would use
German.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the jockey, taking a whiff,
&lsquo;make your conversation as short as possible, whether in
Latin or Dutch, for, to tell you the truth, I am rather tired of
merely playing listener.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were saying you had been in Russia,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;I believe the Russians are part of the Sclavonian
race.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Yes, part of the great Sclavonian
family; one of the most numerous races in the world.&nbsp; The
Russians themselves are very numerous&mdash;would that the
Magyars could boast of the fifth part of their number!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What is the number of the Magyars?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Barely four millions.&nbsp; We came a
tribe of Tartars into Europe and settled down amongst
Sclavonians, whom we conquered, but who never coalesced with
us.&nbsp; The Austrian at present plays in Pannonia the
Sclavonian against us and us against the Sclavonian; but the
downfall of the Austrian is at hand; they, like us, are not a
numerous people.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who will bring about his downfall?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; The Russian.&nbsp; The Rysckie Tsar
will lead his people forth, all the Sclavonians will join him, he
will conquer all before him.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Are the Russians good soldiers?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They are stubborn and unflinching to
an astonishing degree, and their fidelity to their Tsar is quite
admirable.&nbsp; See how the Russians behaved at Plescova, in
Livonia, in the old time, against our great Batory Stephen; they
defended the place till it was a heap of rubbish, and mark how
they behaved after they had been made prisoners.&nbsp; Stephen
offered them two alternatives: to enter into his service, in
which they would have good <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>pay,
clothing, and fair treatment; or to be allowed to return to
Russia.&nbsp; Without the slightest hesitation they, to a man,
chose the latter, though well aware that their beloved Tsar, the
cruel Ivan Basilowitt, would put them all to death, amidst
tortures the most horrible, for not doing what was
impossible&mdash;preserving the town.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You speak Russian?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A little.&nbsp; I was born in the
vicinity of a Sclavonian tribe; the servants of our house were
Sclavonians, and I early acquired something of their language,
which differs not much from that of Russia.&nbsp; When in that
country I quickly understood what was said.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have the Russians any literature?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Doubtless; but I am not acquainted
with it, as I do not read their language; but I know something of
their popular tales, to which I used to listen in their
izbushkas; a principal personage in these is a creation quite
original&mdash;called Baba Yaga.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who is Baba Yaga? <a
name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245"
class="citation">[245]</a></p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A female phantom, who is described as
hurrying along the puszta, or steppe, in a mortar, pounding with
a pestle at a tremendous rate, and leaving a long trace on the
ground behind her with her tongue, which is three yards long, and
with which she seizes any men and horses coming in her way,
swallowing them down into her capacious belly.&nbsp; She has
several daughters, very handsome, and with plenty of money.&nbsp;
Happy the young Mujik who catches and marries one of them, for
they make excellent wives.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many thanks,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for the information
you have afforded me.&nbsp; This is rather poor wine,&rsquo; I
observed as I poured out a glass.&nbsp; &lsquo;I suppose you have
better wine in Hungary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes we have better wine in Hungary.&nbsp; First of all
there is Tokay, the most celebrated in the world, though I
confess I prefer the wine of Eger&mdash;Tokay is too
sweet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you ever been at Tokay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have,&rsquo; said the Hungarian.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of place is Tokay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A small town situated on the Tyzza, a rapid river
descending from the north; the Tokay Mountain is just behind the
town, which stands on the right bank.&nbsp; The <!-- page
246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>top of the mountain is called Kopacs Teto, or the bald
tip; the hill is so steep that during thunder-storms pieces of it
frequently fall down upon the roofs of the houses.&nbsp; It was
planted with vines by King Lajos, who ascended the throne in the
year 1342.&nbsp; The best wine called Tokay is, however, not made
at Tokay, but at Kassau, two leagues farther into the
Carpathians, of which Tokay is a spur.&nbsp; If you wish to drink
the best Tokay, you must go to Vienna, to which place all the
prime is sent.&nbsp; For the third time I ask you, O young man of
Horncastle! why does your Government always send fools to
represent it at Vienna?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And for the third time I tell you, O son of Almus! that
I cannot say; perhaps, however, to drink the Tokay wine.&nbsp;
Fools, you know, always like sweet things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the Hungarian; &lsquo;it must be so,
and when I return to Hungary I will state to my countrymen your
explanation of a circumstance which has frequently caused them
great perplexity.&nbsp; Oh! the English are a clever people, and
have a deep meaning in all they do.&nbsp; What a vision of deep
policy opens itself to my view: they do not send their fool to
Vienna in order to gape at processions, and to bow and scrape at
a base Papist court, but to drink at the great dinners the
celebrated Tokay of Hungary, which the Hungarians, though they do
not drink it, are very proud of, and by doing so to intimate the
sympathy which the English entertain for their fellow
religionists of Hungary.&nbsp; Oh! the English are a deep
people.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<p>THE HORNCASTLE WELCOME&mdash;TZERNEBOCK AND BIELEBOCK</p>
<p>The pipe of the Hungarian had, for some time past, exhibited
considerable symptoms of exhaustion, little or no ruttling having
been heard in the tube, and scarcely a particle of smoke, drawn
through the syphon, having been emitted from the lips of the tall
possessor.&nbsp; He now rose from his seat, and going to a corner
of the room, placed his pipe against the wall, then striding up
and down the room, he cracked his fingers several times,
exclaiming, in a half-musing manner, &lsquo;Oh, <!-- page
247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>the deep nation, which, in order to display its
sympathy for Hungary, sends its fool to Vienna, to drink the
sweet wine of Tokay!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The jockey, having looked for some time at the tall figure
with evident approbation, winked at me with that brilliant eye of
his on which there was no speck, saying, &lsquo;Did you ever see
a taller fellow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or a finer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s another question,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;which I am not so willing to answer; however, as I am fond
of truth, and scorn to flatter, I will take the liberty of saying
that I think I have seen a finer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A finer! where?&rsquo; said the jockey; whilst the
Hungarian, who appeared to understand what we said, stood still,
and looked full at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amongst a strange set of people,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;whom, if I were to name, you would, I dare say, only laugh
at me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who be they?&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come,
don&rsquo;t be ashamed.&nbsp; I have occasionally kept queerish
company myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The people whom we call gypsies,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;whom the Germans call Zigeuner, and who call themselves
Romany chals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Zigeuner!&rsquo; said the Hungarian.&nbsp; &lsquo;By
Isten! I do know these people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Romany chals!&rsquo; said the jockey;
&lsquo;whew!&nbsp; I begin to smell a rat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean by smelling a rat?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a crown,&rsquo; said the jockey,
&lsquo;that you be the young chap what certain folks call
&ldquo;The Romany Rye.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;how came you to know that
name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be not you he?&rsquo; said the jockey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I certainly have been called by that
name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could have sworn it,&rsquo; said the jockey; then
rising from his chair, he laid his pipe on the table, took a
large hand-bell which stood on a sideboard, and going to the
door, opened it, and commenced ringing in a most tremendous
manner on the staircase.&nbsp; The noise presently brought up a
waiter, to whom the jockey vociferated, &lsquo;Go to your master,
and tell him to send immediately three bottles of champagne, of
the pink kind, mind you, which is twelve guineas a
dozen.&rsquo;&nbsp; The waiter hurried away, and the jockey
resumed his seat and his pipe.&nbsp; I <!-- page 248--><a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>sat in
silent astonishment till the waiter returned with a basket
containing the wine, which, with three long glasses, he placed on
the table.&nbsp; The jockey then got up, and going to a large
bow-window at the end of the room, which looked into a
court-yard, peeped out; then saying, &lsquo;The coast is
clear,&rsquo; he shut down the principal sash, which was open for
the sake of the air, and taking up a bottle of the champagne, he
placed another in the hands of the Hungarian, to whom he said
something in private.&nbsp; The latter, who seemed to understand
him, answered by a nod.&nbsp; The two then going to the end of
the table fronting the window, and about eight paces from it,
stood before it, holding the bottles by their necks; suddenly the
jockey lifted up his arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;you are not mad enough to fling that bottle through the
window?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s to the Romany Rye:
here&rsquo;s to the sweet master,&rsquo; said the jockey, dashing
the bottle through a pane in so neat a manner that scarcely a
particle of glass fell into the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eljen edes csigany ur&mdash;eljen gul eray!&rsquo; said
the Hungarian, swinging round his bottle, and discharging it at
the window; but, either not possessing the jockey&rsquo;s
accuracy of aim, or reckless of consequences, he flung his bottle
so that it struck against part of the wooden setting of the
panes, breaking along with the wood and itself three or four
panes to pieces.&nbsp; The crash was horrid, and wine and
particles of glass flew back into the room, to the no small
danger of its inmates.&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you think of
that?&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Were you ever so
honoured before?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Honoured!&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;God preserve me in future from such
honour;&rsquo; and I put my finger to my cheek, which was
slightly hurt by a particle of the glass.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way we of the cofrady honour great men at
Horncastle,&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, you are
hurt! never mind; all the better, your scratch shows that you are
the body the compliment was paid to.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And what
are you going to do with the other bottle?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do with it!&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;why, drink it,
cosily and comfortably, whilst holding a little quiet talk.&nbsp;
The Romany Rye at Horncastle, what an idea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what will the master of the house say to all this
damage which you have caused him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will your master say, William?&rsquo; said the
jockey to the waiter, who had witnessed the singular scene just
<!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>described without exhibiting the slightest mark of
surprise.&nbsp; William smiled, and slightly shrugging his
shoulders, replied, &lsquo;Very little, I dare say, sir; this
ain&rsquo;t the first time your honour has done a thing of this
kind.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nor will it be the first time that I
shall have paid for it,&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I shall have never paid for a certain item in the
bill with more pleasure than I shall pay for it now.&nbsp; Come,
William, draw the cork, and let us taste the pink
champagne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The waiter drew the cork, and filled the glasses with a pinky
liquor, which bubbled, hissed, and foamed.&nbsp; &lsquo;How do
you like it?&rsquo; said the jockey, after I had imitated the
example of my companions by despatching my portion at a
draught.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is wonderful wine,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I have
never tasted champagne before, though I have frequently heard it
praised; it more than answers my expectations; but, I confess, I
should not wish to be obliged to drink it every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;for everyday
drinking give me a glass of old port, or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of hard old ale,&rsquo; I interposed, &lsquo;which,
according to my mind, is better than all the wine in the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well said, Romany Rye,&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Just my own opinion; now, William, make yourself
scarce.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The waiter withdrew, and I said to the jockey, &lsquo;How did
you become acquainted with the Romany chals?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I first became acquainted with them,&rsquo; said the
jockey, &lsquo;when I lived with old Fulcher the basket-maker,
who took me up when I was adrift upon the world; I do not mean
the present Fulcher, who is likewise called old Fulcher, but his
father, who has been dead this many a year; while living with him
in the caravan, I frequently met them in the green lanes, and of
latter years I have had occasional dealings with them in the
horse line.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the gypsies have mentioned me to you?&rsquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frequently,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;and not only
those of these parts; why, there&rsquo;s scarcely a part of
England in which I have not heard the name of the Romany Rye
mentioned by these people.&nbsp; The power you have over them is
wonderful; that is, I should have thought it wonderful, had they
not more than once told me the cause.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is the cause?&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for I am
sure I do not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&lsquo;The cause is this,&rsquo; said the jockey:
&lsquo;they never heard a bad word proceed from your mouth, and
never knew you do a bad thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are a singular people,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what a singular language they have got,&rsquo; said
the jockey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know it?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only a few words,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;they
were always chary in teaching me any.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were vary sherry to me too,&rsquo; said the
Hungarian, speaking in broken English; &lsquo;I only could learn
from them half a dozen words, for example, gul eray, <a
name="citation250a"></a><a href="#footnote250a"
class="citation">[250a]</a> which, in the czigany of my country,
means sweet gentleman; or edes ur in my own Magyar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gudlo Rye, in the Romany of mine, means a sugar&rsquo;d
gentleman,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;then there are gypsies in your
country?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plenty,&rsquo; said the Hungarian, speaking German,
&lsquo;and in Russia and Turkey too; and wherever they are found,
they are alike in their ways and language.&nbsp; Oh, they are a
strange race, and how little known!&nbsp; I know little of them,
but enough to say, that one horse-load of nonsense has been
written about them; there is one Valter Scott&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mind what you say about him,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;he
is our grand authority in matters of philology and
history.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pretty philologist,&rsquo; said the Hungarian,
&lsquo;who makes the gypsies speak Roth-Welsch, <a
name="citation250b"></a><a href="#footnote250b"
class="citation">[250b]</a> the dialect of thieves; a pretty
historian, who couples together Thor and Tzernebock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where does he do that?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In his conceited romance of Ivanhoe he couples Thor and
Tzernebock together, and calls them gods of the heathen
Saxons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;Thur or Thor was certainly
a god of the heathen Saxons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said the Hungarian; &lsquo;but why couple
him with Tzernebock?&nbsp; Tzernebock was a word which your
Valter had picked up somewhere without knowing the meaning.&nbsp;
Tzernebock was no god of the Saxons, but one of the gods of the
Sclaves, on the southern side of the Baltic.&nbsp; The Sclaves
had two grand gods to whom they <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>sacrificed,
Tzernebock and Bielebock; that is, the black and white gods, who
represented the powers of dark and light.&nbsp; They were
overturned by Waldemar, the Dane, the great enemy of the Sclaves;
the account of whose wars you will find in one fine old book,
written by Saxo Gramaticus, which I read in the library of the
college of Debreczen.&nbsp; The Sclaves, at one time, were
masters of all the southern shore of the Baltic, where their
descendants are still to be found, though they have lost their
language, and call themselves Germans; but the word Zernevitz
near Dantzic, still attests that the Sclavic language was once
common in those parts.&nbsp; Zernevitz means the thing of
blackness, as Tzernebock means the god of blackness.&nbsp;
Prussia itself merely means, in Sclavish, Lower Russia.&nbsp;
There is scarcely a race or language in the world more extended
than the Sclavic.&nbsp; On the other side of the Dunau you will
find the Sclaves and their language.&nbsp; Czernavoda is Sclavic,
and means black water; in Turkish, kara su; even as Tzernebock
means black god; and Belgrade, or Belograd, means the white town;
even as Bielebock, or Bielebog, means the white god.&nbsp; Oh! he
is one great ignorant, that Valter.&nbsp; He is going, they say,
to write one history about Napoleon.&nbsp; I do hope that in his
history he will couple his Thor and Tzernebock together.&nbsp; By
my God! it would be good diversion that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Walter Scott appears to be no particular favourite of
yours,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not,&rsquo; said the Hungarian; &lsquo;I hate him
for his slavish principles.&nbsp; He wishes to see absolute power
restored in this country, and Popery also; and I hate him
because&mdash;what do you think?&nbsp; In one of his novels,
published a few months ago, he has the insolence to insult
Hungary in the person of one of her sons.&nbsp; He makes his
great braggart, Cour de Lion, fling a Magyar over his head.&nbsp;
Ha! it was well for Richard that he never felt the grip of a
Hungarian.&nbsp; I wish the braggart could have felt the grip of
me, who am &ldquo;a&rsquo; Magyarok k&ouml;zt legkissebb,&rdquo;
the least among the Magyars.&nbsp; I do hate that Scott, and all
his vile gang of Lowlanders and Highlanders.&nbsp; The black
corps, the fekete regiment of Matyjas Hunyadi, was worth all the
Scots, high or low, that ever pretended to be soldiers; and would
have sent them all headlong into the Black Sea, had they dared to
confront <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>it on its shores; but why be angry
with an ignorant, who couples together Thor and Tzernebock?&nbsp;
Ha! ha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have read his novels?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I read them now and then.&nbsp; I do not speak
much English, but I can read it well, and I have read some of his
romances, and mean to read his Napoleon, in the hope of finding
Thor and Tzernebock coupled together in it, as in his high-flying
Ivanhoe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;no more Dutch,
whether high or low.&nbsp; I am tired of it; unless we can have
some English, I am off to bed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be very glad to hear some English,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;especially from your mouth.&nbsp; Several things which
you have mentioned have awakened my curiosity.&nbsp; Suppose you
give us your history?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My history?&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;A rum
idea! however, lest conversation should lag, I&rsquo;ll give it
you.&nbsp; First of all, however, a glass of champagne to
each.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After we had each taken a glass of champagne, the jockey
commenced his history.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<p>THE JOCKEY&rsquo;S TALE&mdash;THIEVES&rsquo;
LATIN&mdash;LIBERTIES WITH COIN&mdash;THE SMASHER IN
PRISON&mdash;OLD FULCHER&mdash;EVERY ONE HAS HIS
GIFT&mdash;FASHION OF THE ENGLISH</p>
<p>&lsquo;My grandfather was a shorter, and my father was a
smasher; the one was scragg&rsquo;d, and the other
lagg&rsquo;d.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I here interrupted the jockey by observing that his discourse
was, for the greater part, unintelligible to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not understand much English,&rsquo; said the
Hungarian, who, having replenished and resumed his mighty pipe,
was now smoking away; &lsquo;but, by Isten, I believe it is the
gibberish which that great ignorant Valther Scott puts into the
mouth of the folks he calls gypsies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Something like it, I confess,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;though this sounds more genuine than his dialect, which he
picked up out of the canting vocabulary at the end of the
&ldquo;English Rogue,&rdquo; <a name="citation252"></a><a
href="#footnote252" class="citation">[252]</a> a book which,
however despised, <!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>was written by a remarkable
genius.&nbsp; What do you call the speech you were using?&rsquo;
said I, addressing myself to the jockey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Latin,&rsquo; said the jockey, very coolly, &lsquo;that
is, that dialect of it which is used by the light-fingered
gentry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is right,&rsquo; said the Hungarian; &lsquo;it is
what the Germans call Roth-Welsch: they call it so because there
are a great many Latin words in it, introduced by the priests,
who, at the time of the Reformation, being too lazy to work, and
too stupid to preach, joined the bands of thieves and robbers who
prowled about the county.&nbsp; Italy, as you are aware, is
called by the Germans Welschland, or the land of the Welschers;
and I may add that Wallachia derives its name from a colony of
Welschers which Trajan sent there.&nbsp; Welsch and Wallack being
one and the same word, and tantamount to Latin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say you are right,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but why
was Italy termed Welschland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know,&rsquo; said the Hungarian.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I think I can tell you,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;it
was called so because the original inhabitants were a Cimbric
tribe, who were called Gwyltiad, that is, a race of wild people,
living in coverts, who were of the same blood, and spoke the same
language as the present inhabitants of Wales.&nbsp; Welsh seems
merely a modification of Gwyltiad.&nbsp; Pray continue your
history,&rsquo; said I to the jockey, &lsquo;only please to do so
in a language which we can understand, and first of all interpret
the sentence with which you began it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you that my grandfather was a shorter,&rsquo;
said the jockey, &lsquo;by which is meant a gentleman who
shortens or reduces the current coin of these realms, for which
practice he was scragged, that is, hung by the scrag of the
neck.&nbsp; And when I said that my father was a smasher, I meant
one who passes forged notes, thereby doing his best to smash the
Bank of England; by being lagg&rsquo;d, I meant he was laid fast,
that is, had a chain put round his leg and then
transported.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your explanations are perfectly satisfactory,&rsquo;
said I; &lsquo;the three first words are metaphorical, and the
fourth, lagg&rsquo;d, is the old genuine Norse term, lagda, which
signifies laid, whether in durance, or in bed has nothing to do
with the matter.&nbsp; What you have told me confirms me in an
opinion which I have long entertained, that thieves&rsquo; Latin
is a strange mysterious speech, formed of metaphorical <!-- page
254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>terms, and words derived from various ancient
languages.&nbsp; Pray tell me, now, how the gentleman, your
grandfather, contrived to shorten the coin of these
realms?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall hear,&rsquo; said the jockey; &lsquo;but I
have one thing to beg of you, which is, that when I have once
begun my history you will not interrupt me with questions; I
don&rsquo;t like them, they stops one, and puts one out of
one&rsquo;s tale, and are not wanted.&nbsp; For anything which I
think can&rsquo;t be understood, I should myself explain, without
being asked.&nbsp; My grandfather reduced or shortened the coin
of this country by three processes.&nbsp; By aquafortis, by
clipping, and by filing.&nbsp; Filing and clipping he employed in
reducing all kinds of coin, whether gold or silver; but
aquafortis he used merely in reducing gold coin, whether guineas,
jacobuses, or Portugal pieces, otherwise called moidores, which
were at one time as current as guineas.&nbsp; By laying a guinea
in aquafortis for twelve hours he could filch from it to the
value of ninepence, and by letting it remain there for
twenty-four, to the value of eighteenpence, the aquafortis eating
the gold away, and leaving it like a sediment in the
vessel.&nbsp; He was generally satisfied with taking the value of
ninepence from a guinea, of eighteenpence from a jacobus or
moidore, or half-a-crown from a broad Spanish piece, whether he
reduced them by aquafortis, filing, or clipping.&nbsp; From a
five-shilling piece, which is called a bull in Latin, because it
is round like a bull&rsquo;s head, he would file or clip to the
value of five-pence, and from lesser coin in proportion.&nbsp; He
was connected with a numerous gang, or set, of people, who had
given up their minds and talents entirely to
shortening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here I interrupted the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;How
singular,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is the fall and debasement of
words; you talk of a gang, or set of shorters; you are, perhaps,
not aware that gang and set were, a thousand years ago, only
connected with the great and Divine: they are ancient Norse
words, which may be found in the heroic poems of the north, and
in the Edda, a collection of mythologic and heroic songs.&nbsp;
In these poems we read that such and such a king invaded Norway
with a gang of heroes, or so and so&mdash;for example, Erik
Bloodaxe&mdash;was admitted to the set of gods; but at present
gang and set are merely applied to the vilest of the vile, and
the lowest of the low.&nbsp; We say a gang of thieves and
shorters, or a set of <!-- page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>authors.&nbsp; How touching is this
debasement of words in the course of time!&nbsp; It puts me in
mind of the decay of old houses and names.&nbsp; I have known a
Mortimer who was a hedger and ditcher, a Berners who was born in
a workhouse, and a descendant of the De Burghs, who bore the
falcon, mending old kettles, and making horse and pony shoes in a
dingle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Odd enough,&rsquo; said the jockey; &lsquo;but you were
saying you knew one Berners&mdash;man or woman? I would
ask.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A woman,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What might her Christian name be?&rsquo; said the
jockey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not to be mentioned lightly,&rsquo; said I, with
a sigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it were Isopel,&rsquo; said
the jockey, with an arch glance of his one brilliant eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was Isopel,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you know
Isopel Berners?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and have reason to know her,&rsquo; said the
jockey, putting his hand into his left waistcoat-pocket, as if to
feel for something, &lsquo;for she gave me what I believe few men
could do&mdash;a most confounded wapping.&nbsp; But now, Mr.
Romany Rye, I have again to tell you that I don&rsquo;t like to
be interrupted when I&rsquo;m speaking, and to add that if you
break in upon me a third time, you and I shall
quarrel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray proceed with your story,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I
will not interrupt you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where was
I?&nbsp; Oh, with a set of people who had given up their minds to
shortening!&nbsp; Reducing the coin, though rather a lucrative,
was a very dangerous, trade.&nbsp; Coin filed felt rough to the
touch; coin clipped could be easily detected by the eye; and as
for coin reduced by aquafortis, it was generally so discoloured
that, unless a great deal of pains was used to polish it, people
were apt to stare at it in a strange manner, and to say,
&ldquo;What have they been doing to this here gold?&rdquo;&nbsp;
My grandfather, as I said before, was connected with a gang of
shorters, and sometimes shortened money, and at other times
passed off what had been shortened by other gentry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Passing off what had been shortened by others was his
ruin; for once, in trying to pass off a broad piece which had
been laid in aquafortis for four-and-twenty hours, and was very
black, not having been properly rectified, he was stopped and
searched, and other reduced coins being found about him and in
his lodgings, <!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>he was committed to prison, tried,
and executed.&nbsp; He was offered his life, provided he would
betray his comrades, but he told the big-wigs, who wanted him to
do so, that he would see them farther first, and died at Tyburn,
amidst the cheers of the populace, leaving my grandmother and
father, to whom he had always been a kind husband and
parent&mdash;for, setting aside the crime for which he suffered,
he was a moral man&mdash;leaving them, I say, to bewail his
irreparable loss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis said that misfortune never comes alone; this
is, however, not always the case.&nbsp; Shortly after my
grandfather&rsquo;s misfortune, as my grandmother and her son
were living in great misery in Spitalfields, her only
relation&mdash;a brother from whom she had been estranged some
years, on account of her marriage with my grandfather, who had
been in an inferior station to herself&mdash;died, leaving all
his property to her and the child.&nbsp; This property consisted
of a farm of about a hundred acres, with its stock and some money
besides.&nbsp; My grandmother, who knew something of business,
instantly went into the country, where she farmed the property
for her own benefit and that of her son, to whom she gave an
education suitable to a person in his condition, till he was old
enough to manage the farm himself.&nbsp; Shortly after the young
man came of age, my grandmother died, and my father, in about a
year, married the daughter of a farmer, from whom he expected
some little fortune, but who very much deceived him, becoming a
bankrupt almost immediately after the marriage of his daughter,
and himself and family going to the workhouse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother, however, made my father an excellent wife;
and if my father in the long run did not do well, it was no fault
of hers.&nbsp; My father was not a bad man by nature, he was of
an easy, generous temper&mdash;the most unfortunate temper,
by-the-by, for success in this life that any person can be
possessed of, as those who have it are almost sure to be made
dupes of by the designing.&nbsp; But, though easy and generous,
he was anything but a fool; he had a quick and witty tongue of
his own when he chose to exert it, and woe be to those who
insulted him openly, for there was not a better boxer in the
whole country round.&nbsp; My parents were married several years
before I came into the world, who was their first and only
child.&nbsp; I may be called an unfortunate creature; <!-- page
257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>I
was born with this beam or scale on my left eye, which does not
allow me to see with it; and though I can see tolerably sharply
with the other, indeed more than most people can with both of
theirs, it is a great misfortune not to have two eyes like other
people.&nbsp; Moreover, setting aside the affair of my eye, I had
a very ugly countenance; my mouth being slightly wrung aside, and
my complexion rather swarthy.&nbsp; In fact, I looked so queer
that the gossips and neighbours, when they first saw me, swore I
was a changeling&mdash;perhaps it would have been well if I had
never been born; for my poor father, who had been particularly
anxious to have a son, no sooner saw me than he turned away, went
to the neighbouring town, and did not return for two days.&nbsp;
I am by no means certain that I was not the cause of his ruin,
for till I came into the world he was fond of his home, and
attended much to business, but afterwards he went frequently into
company, and did not seem to care much about his affairs: he was,
however, a kind man, and when his wife gave him advice never
struck her, nor do I ever remember that he kicked me when I came
in his way, or so much as cursed my ugly face, though it was easy
to see that he didn&rsquo;t over like me.&nbsp; When I was six
years old I was sent to the village-school, where I was soon
booked for a dunce, because the master found it impossible to
teach me either to read or write.&nbsp; Before I had been at
school two years, however, I had beaten boys four years older
than myself, and could fling a stone with my left hand (for if I
am right-eyed I am left-handed) higher and farther than any one
in the parish.&nbsp; Moreover, no boy could equal me at riding,
and no people ride so well or desperately as boys.&nbsp; I could
ride a donkey&mdash;a thing far more difficult to ride than a
horse&mdash;at full gallop over hedges and ditches, seated or
rather floating upon his hinder part,&mdash;so though anything
but clever, as this here Romany Rye would say, I was yet able to
do things which few other people could do.&nbsp; By the time I
was ten my father&rsquo;s affairs had got into a very desperate
condition, for he had taken to gambling and horse-racing, and,
being unsuccessful, had sold his stock, mortgaged his estate, and
incurred very serious debts.&nbsp; The upshot was, that within a
little time all he had was seized, himself imprisoned, and my
mother and myself put into a cottage belonging to the parish,
which, being <!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>very cold and damp, was the cause of
her catching a fever, which speedily carried her off.&nbsp; I was
then bound apprentice to a farmer, in whose service I underwent
much coarse treatment, cold and hunger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After lying in prison near two years, my father was
liberated by an Act for the benefit of insolvent debtors; he was
then lost sight of for some time, at last, however, he made his
appearance in the neighbourhood dressed like a gentleman, and
seemingly possessed of plenty of money.&nbsp; He came to see me,
took me into a field, and asked me how I was getting on.&nbsp; I
told him I was dreadfully used, and begged him to take me away
with him; he refused, and told me to be satisfied with my
condition, for that he could do nothing for me.&nbsp; I had a
great love for my father, and likewise a great admiration for him
on account of his character as a boxer, the only character which
boys in general regard, so I wished much to be with him,
independently of the dog&rsquo;s life I was leading where I was;
I therefore said if he would not take me with him, I would follow
him; he replied that I must do no such thing, for that if I did,
it would be my ruin.&nbsp; I asked him what he meant, but he made
no reply, only saying that he would go and speak to the
farmer.&nbsp; Then taking me with him he went to the farmer and
in a very civil manner said that he understood I had not been
very kindly treated by him, but he hoped that in future I should
be used better.&nbsp; The farmer answered in a surly tone, that I
had been only too well treated, for that I was a worthless young
scoundrel; high words ensued, and the farmer, forgetting the kind
of man he had to deal with, checked him with my grandsire&rsquo;s
misfortune, and said he deserved to be hanged like his
father.&nbsp; In a moment my father knocked him down, and on his
getting up gave him a terrible beating, then taking me by the
hand he hastened away; as we were going down a lane he said we
were now both done for: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a straw for
that, father,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;provided I be with
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; My father took me to the neighbouring town, and
going into the yard of a small inn, he ordered out a pony and
light cart which belonged to him, then paying his bill, he told
me to mount upon the seat, and getting up drove away like
lightning; we drove for at least six hours without stopping, till
we came to a cottage by the side of a heath; we put the pony and
cart into a shed and went into the <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>cottage, my
father unlocking the door with a key which he took out of his
pocket; there was nobody in the cottage when we arrived, but
shortly after there came a man and woman, and then some more
people, and by ten o&rsquo;clock at night there were a dozen of
us in the cottage.&nbsp; The people were companions of my
father.&nbsp; My father began talking to them in Latin, but I did
not understand much of the discourse, though I believe it was
about myself, as their eyes were frequently turned to me.&nbsp;
Some objections appeared to be made to what he said; however, all
at last seemed to be settled, and we all sat down to some
food.&nbsp; After that all the people got up and went away, with
the exception of the woman, who remained with my father and
me.&nbsp; The next day my father also departed, leaving me with
the woman, telling me before he went that she would teach me some
things which it behoved me to know.&nbsp; I remained with her in
the cottage upwards of a week; several of those who had been
there coming and going.&nbsp; The woman, after making me take an
oath to be faithful, told me that the people whom I had seen were
a gang who got their livelihood by passing forged notes, and that
my father was a principal man amongst them, adding, that I must
do my best to assist them.&nbsp; I was a poor ignorant child at
that time, and I made no objection, thinking that whatever my
father did must be right; the woman then gave me some
instructions in the smasher&rsquo;s dialect of the Latin
language.&nbsp; I made great progress, because for the first time
in my life, I paid great attention to my lessons.&nbsp; At last
my father returned, and, after some conversation with the woman,
took me away in his cart.&nbsp; I shall be very short about what
happened to my father and myself during two years.&nbsp; My
father did his best to smash the Bank of England by passing
forged notes, and I did my best to assist him.&nbsp; We attended
races and fairs in all kinds of disguises; my father was a
first-rate hand at a disguise, and could appear of all ages from
twenty to fourscore; he was, however, grabbed at last.&nbsp; He
had said, as I have told you, that he should be my ruin, but I
was the cause of his, and all owing to the misfortune of this
here eye of mine.&nbsp; We came to this very place of Horncastle,
where my father purchased two horses of a young man, paying for
them with three forged notes, purporting to be Bank of Englanders
of fifty pounds <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>each, and got the young man to
change another of the like amount; he at that time appeared as a
respectable dealer, and I as his son, as I really was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as we had got the horses, we conveyed them to
one of the places of call belonging to our gang, of which there
were several.&nbsp; There they were delivered into the hands of
one of our companions, who speedily sold them in a distant part
of the country.&nbsp; The sum which they fetched&mdash;for the
gang kept very regular accounts&mdash;formed an important item on
the next day of sharing, of which there were twelve in the
year.&nbsp; The young man, whom my father had paid for the horses
with his smashing notes, was soon in trouble about them, and ran
some risk, as I have heard, of being executed; but he bore a good
character, told a plain story, and, above all, had friends, and
was admitted to bail; to one of his friends he described my
father and myself.&nbsp; This person happened to be at an inn in
Yorkshire, where my father, disguised as a Quaker, attempted to
pass a forged note.&nbsp; The note was shown to this individual,
who pronounced it a forgery, it being exactly similar to those
for which the young man had been in trouble, and which he had
seen.&nbsp; My father, however, being supposed a respectable man,
because he was dressed as a Quaker&mdash;the very reason,
by-the-by, why anybody who knew aught of the Quakers would have
suspected him to be a rogue&mdash;would have been let go, had I
not made my appearance, dressed as his footboy.&nbsp; The friend
of the young man looked at my eye, and seized hold of my father,
who made a desperate resistance, I assisting him, as in duty
bound.&nbsp; Being, however, overpowered by numbers, he bade me
by a look, and a word or two in Latin, to make myself
scarce.&nbsp; Though my heart was fit to break, I obeyed my
father, who was speedily committed.&nbsp; I followed him to the
county town in which he was lodged, where shortly after I saw him
tried, convicted, and condemned.&nbsp; I then, having made
friends with the jailor&rsquo;s wife, visited him in his cell,
where I found him very much cast down.&nbsp; He said, that my
mother had appeared to him in a dream, and talked to him about a
resurrection and Christ Jesus; there was a Bible before him, and
he told me the chaplain had just been praying with him.&nbsp; He
reproached himself much, saying, he was afraid he had been my
ruin, by teaching me bad habits.&nbsp; I told him not to say any
such <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>thing, for that I had been the cause
of his, owing to the misfortune of my eye.&nbsp; He begged me to
give over all unlawful pursuits, saying, that if persisted in,
they were sure of bringing a person to destruction.&nbsp; I
advised him to try and make his escape; proposing, that when the
turnkey came to let me out, he should knock him down, and fight
his way out, offering to assist him; showing him a small saw,
with which one of our companions, who was in the neighbourhood,
had provided me, and with which he could have cut through his
fetters in five minutes; but he told me he had no wish to escape,
and was quite willing to die.&nbsp; I was rather hard at that
time; I am not very soft now; and I felt rather ashamed of my
father&rsquo;s want of what I called spirit.&nbsp; He was not
executed after all; for the chaplain, who was connected with a
great family, stood his friend, and got his sentence commuted, as
they call it, to transportation; and in order to make the matter
easy, he induced my father to make some valuable disclosures with
respect to the smasher&rsquo;s system.&nbsp; I confess that I
would have been hanged before I would have done so, after having
reaped the profit of it; that is, I think so now, seated
comfortably in my inn, with my bottle of champagne before
me.&nbsp; He, however, did not show himself carrion; he would not
betray his companions, who had behaved very handsomely to him,
having given the son of a lord, a great barrister, not a
hundred-pound forged bill, but a hundred hard guineas, to plead
his cause, and another ten, to induce him, after pleading, to put
his hand to his breast, and say, that, upon his honour, he
believed the prisoner at the bar to be an honest and injured
man.&nbsp; No: I am glad to be able to say, that my father did
not show himself exactly carrion, though I could almost have
wished he had let himself&mdash;.&nbsp; However, I am here with
my bottle of champagne and the Romany Rye, and he was in his
cell, with bread and water and the prison chaplain.&nbsp; He took
an affectionate leave of me before he was sent away, giving me
three out of five guineas, all the money he had left.&nbsp; He
was a kind man, but not exactly fitted to fill my
grandfather&rsquo;s shoes.&nbsp; I afterwards learned that he
died of fever, as he was being carried across the sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During the &rsquo;sizes, I had made acquaintance with
old Fulcher.&nbsp; I was in the town on my father&rsquo;s
account, and he was there on his son&rsquo;s, who, having
committed a small <!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>larceny, was in trouble.&nbsp; Young
Fulcher, however, unlike my father, got off, though he did not
give the son of a lord a hundred guineas to speak for him, and
ten more to pledge his sacred honour for his honesty, but gave
Counsellor P--- one-and-twenty shillings to defend him, who so
frightened the principal evidence, a plain honest farming man,
that he flatly contradicted what he had first said, and at last
acknowledged himself to be all the rogues in the world, and,
amongst other things, a perjured villain.&nbsp; Old Fulcher,
before he left the town with his son&mdash;and here it will be
well to say that he and his son left it in a kind of triumph, the
base drummer of a militia regiment, to whom they had given
half-a-crown, beating his drum before them&mdash;old Fulcher, I
say, asked me to go and visit him, telling me where, at such a
time, I might find him and his caravan and family; offering, if I
thought fit, to teach me basket-making: so, after my father had
been sent off, I went and found up old Fulcher, and became his
apprentice in the basket-making line.&nbsp; I stayed with him
till the time of his death, which happened in about three months,
travelling about with him and his family, and living in green
lanes, where we saw gypsies and trampers, and all kinds of
strange characters.&nbsp; Old Fulcher, besides being an
industrious basket-maker, was an out and out thief, as was also
his son, and, indeed, every member of his family.&nbsp; They used
to make baskets during the day, and thieve during a great part of
the night.&nbsp; I had not been with them twelve hours, before
old Fulcher told me that I must thieve as well as the rest.&nbsp;
I demurred at first, for I remembered the fate of my father, and
what he had told me about leaving off bad courses, but soon
allowed myself to be over-persuaded; more especially as the first
robbery I was asked to do was a fruit robbery.&nbsp; I was to go
with young Fulcher, and steal some fine Morell cherries, which
grew against a wall in a gentleman&rsquo;s garden; so young
Fulcher and I went and stole the cherries, one half of which we
ate, and gave the rest to the old man, who sold them to a
fruiterer ten miles off from the place where we had stolen
them.&nbsp; The next night old Fulcher took me out with
himself.&nbsp; He was a great thief, though in a small way.&nbsp;
He used to say, that they were fools, who did not always manage
to keep the rope below their shoulders, by which he meant, that
it was not advisable to commit a robbery or do anything <!-- page
263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>which could bring you to the gallows.&nbsp; He was all
for petty larceny, and knew where to put his hand upon any little
thing in England, which it was possible to steal.&nbsp; I submit
it to the better judgment of the Romany Rye, who I see is a great
hand for words and names, whether he ought not to have been
called old Filcher, instead of Fulcher.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t give
a regular account of the larcenies which he committed during the
short time I knew him, either alone by himself, or with me and
his son.&nbsp; I shall merely relate the last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A melancholy gentleman, who lived a very solitary life,
had a large carp in a shady pond in a meadow close to his house:
he was exceedingly fond of it, and used to feed it with his own
hand, the creature being so tame that it would put its snout out
of the water to be fed when it was whistled to; feeding and
looking at his carp were the only pleasures the poor melancholy
gentleman possessed.&nbsp; Old Fulcher&mdash;being in the
neighbourhood, and having an order from a fishmonger for a large
fish, which was wanted at a great city dinner, at which His
Majesty was to be present&mdash;swore he would steal the carp,
and asked me to go with him.&nbsp; I had heard of the
gentleman&rsquo;s fondness for his creature, and begged him to
let it be, advising him to go and steal some other fish; but old
Fulcher swore, and said he would have the carp, although its
master should hang himself; I told him he might go by himself,
but he took his son and stole the carp, which weighed seventeen
pounds.&nbsp; Old Fulcher got thirty shillings for the carp,
which I afterwards heard was much admired and relished by His
Majesty.&nbsp; The master, however, of the carp, on losing his
favourite, became more melancholy than ever, and in a little time
hanged himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s sport for one, is death
to another,&rdquo; I once heard at the village-school read out of
a copy-book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This was the last larceny old Fulcher ever
committed.&nbsp; He could keep his neck always out of the noose,
but he could not always keep his leg out of the trap.&nbsp; A few
nights after, having removed to a distance, he went to an osier
car in order to steal some osiers for his basket-making, for he
never bought any.&nbsp; I followed a little way behind.&nbsp; Old
Fulcher had frequently stolen osiers out of the car, whilst in
the neighbourhood, but during his absence the property, of which
the car was part, had been let to a young gentleman, a great hand
for preserving <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>game.&nbsp; Old Fulcher had not got
far into the car before he put his foot into a man-trap.&nbsp;
Hearing old Fulcher shriek, I ran up, and found him in a dreadful
condition.&nbsp; Putting a large stick which I carried into the
jaws of the trap, I contrived to prize them open, and get old
Fulcher&rsquo;s leg out, but the leg was broken.&nbsp; So I ran
to the caravan, and told young Fulcher of what had happened, and
he and I went and helped his father home.&nbsp; A doctor was sent
for, who said that it was necessary to take the leg off, but old
Fulcher, being very much afraid of pain, said it should not be
taken off, and the doctor went away, but after some days, old
Fulcher becoming worse, ordered the doctor to be sent for, who
came and took off his leg, but it was then too late,
mortification had come on, and in a little time old Fulcher
died.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus perished old Fulcher; he was succeeded in his
business by his son, young Fulcher, who, immediately after the
death of his father, was called old Fulcher, it being our English
custom to call everybody old, as soon as their fathers are
buried; young Fulcher&mdash;I mean he who had been called young,
but was now old Fulcher&mdash;wanted me to go out and commit
larcenies with him; but I told him that I would have nothing more
to do with thieving, having seen the ill effects of it, and that
I should leave them in the morning.&nbsp; Old Fulcher begged me
to think better of it, and his mother joined with him.&nbsp; They
offered, if I would stay, to give me Mary Fulcher as a mort, <a
name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> till she and I were old enough to be
regularly married, she being the daughter of the one, and the
sister of the other.&nbsp; I liked the girl very well, for she
had been always civil to me, and had a fair complexion and nice
red hair, both of which I like, being a bit of a black myself;
but I refused, being determined to see something more of the
world than I could hope to do with the Fulchers, and, moreover,
to live honestly, which I could never do along with them.&nbsp;
So the next morning I left them: I was, as I said before, quite
determined upon an honest livelihood, and I soon found one.&nbsp;
He is a great fool who is ever dishonest in England.&nbsp; Any
person who has any natural gift, and everybody has some natural
gift, is sure of finding encouragement in this noble country of
ours, provided he will but exhibit it.&nbsp; I had <!-- page
265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>not walked more than three miles before I came to a
wonderfully high church steeple, which stood close by the road; I
looked at the steeple, and going to a heap of smooth pebbles
which lay by the roadside, I took up some, and then went into the
churchyard, and placing myself just below the tower, my right
foot resting on a ledge, about two foot from the ground, I, with
my left hand&mdash;being a left-handed person do you
see&mdash;flung or chucked up a stone, which lighting on the top
of the steeple, which was at least a hundred and fifty feet high,
did there remain.&nbsp; After repeating this feat two or three
times, I &ldquo;hulled&rdquo; up a stone, which went clean over
the tower, and then one, my right foot still on the ledge, which
rising at least five yards above the steeple, did fall down just
at my feet.&nbsp; Without knowing it, I was showing off my gift
to others besides myself, doing what, perhaps, not five men in
England could do.&nbsp; Two men, who were passing by, stopped and
looked at my proceedings, and when I had done flinging came into
the churchyard, and, after paying me a compliment on what they
had seen me do, proposed that I should join company with them; I
asked them who they were, and they told me.&nbsp; The one was
Hopping Ned, and the other Biting Giles.&nbsp; Both had their
gifts, by which they got their livelihood; Ned could hop a
hundred yards with any man in England, and Giles could lift up
with his teeth any dresser or kitchen-table in the country, and,
standing erect, hold it dangling in his jaws.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
many a big oak table and dresser, in certain districts of
England, which bear the marks of Giles&rsquo;s teeth; and I make
no doubt that, a hundred or two years hence, there&rsquo;ll be
strange stories about those marks, and that people will point
them out as a proof that there were giants in bygone time, and
that many a dentist will moralize on the decays which human teeth
have undergone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They wanted me to go about with them, and exhibit my
gift occasionally, as they did theirs, promising that the money
that was got by the exhibitions should be honestly divided.&nbsp;
I consented, and we set off together, and that evening coming to
a village, and putting up at the ale-house, all the grand folks
of the village being there smoking their pipes, we contrived to
introduce the subject of hopping&mdash;the upshot being that Ned
hopped against the schoolmaster for a pound, and beat him <!--
page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>hollow; shortly after, Giles, for a wager, took up the
kitchen table in his jaws, though he had to pay a shilling to the
landlady for the marks he left, whose grandchildren will perhaps
get money by exhibiting them.&nbsp; As for myself, I did nothing
that day, but the next, on which my companions did nothing, I
showed off at hulling stones against a cripple, the crack man for
stone throwing, of a small town, a few miles farther on.&nbsp;
Bets were made to the tune of some pounds; I contrived to beat
the cripple, and just contrived; for to do him justice I must
acknowledge he was a first-rate hand at stones, though he had a
game hip, and went sideways; his head, when he walked&mdash;if
his movements could be called walking&mdash;not being above three
feet above the ground.&nbsp; So we travelled, I and my
companions, showing off our gifts, Giles and I occasionally for a
gathering, but Ned never hopping unless against somebody for a
wager.&nbsp; We lived honestly and comfortably, making no little
money by our natural endowments, and were known over a great part
of England as &ldquo;Hopping Ned,&rdquo; &ldquo;Biting
Giles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hull over the head Jack,&rdquo; which
was my name, it being the blackguard fashion of the English, do
you see, to&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here I interrupted the jockey, &lsquo;You may call it a
blackguard fashion,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and I dare say it is,
or it would scarcely be English; but it is an immensely ancient
one, and is handed down to us from our northern ancestry,
especially the Danes, who were in the habit of giving people
surnames, or rather nicknames, from some quality of body or mind,
but generally from some disadvantageous peculiarity of feature;
for there is no denying that the English, Norse, or whatever we
may please to call them, are an envious depreciatory set of
people, who not only give their poor comrades contemptuous
surnames, but their great people also.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t
call you the matchless Hurler, because, by doing so, they would
have paid you a compliment, but Hull over the head Jack, as much
as to say that after all you were a scrub: so, in ancient time,
instead of calling Regner the great conqueror, the Nation Tamer,
they surnamed him Lodbrog, which signifies Rough or Hairy
Breeks&mdash;lod or loddin signifying rough or hairy; and instead
of complimenting Halgerdr, the wife of Gunnar of Hlitharend, the
great champion of Iceland, upon her <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>majestic
presence, by calling her Halgerdr, the stately or tall; what must
they do but term her Ha-brokr, or High Breeks, it being the
fashion in old times for Northern ladies to wear breeks, or
breeches, which English ladies of the present day never think of
doing; and just, as of old, they called Halgerdr Long-breeks, so
this very day a fellow of Horncastle called, in my hearing, our
noble-looking Hungarian friend here, Long-stockings.&nbsp; Oh, I
could give you a hundred instances, both ancient and modern, of
this unseemly propensity of our illustrious race, though I will
only trouble you with a few more ancient ones; they not only
nicknamed Regner, but his sons also, who were all kings, and
distinguished men: one, whose name was Biorn, they nicknamed
Ironsides; another Sigurd, Snake in the Eye; another, White Sark,
or White Shirt&mdash;I wonder they did not call him Dirty Shirt,
and Ivarr, another, who was King of Northumberland, they called
Beinlausi, or the Legless, because he was spindle-shanked, had no
sap in his bones, and consequently no children.&nbsp; He was a
great king, it is true, and very wise, nevertheless his
blackguard countrymen, always averse, as their descendants are,
to give credit to anybody, for any valuable quality or
possession, must needs lay hold, do you see&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>But before I could say any more, the jockey, having laid down
his pipe, rose, and having taken off his coat, advanced towards
me.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<p>A SHORT-TEMPERED PERSON&mdash;GRAVITATION&mdash;THE BEST
ENDOWMENT&mdash;MARY FULCHER&mdash;FAIR
DEALING&mdash;HORSE-WITCHERY&mdash;DARIUS AND HIS GROOM&mdash;THE
JOCKEY&rsquo;S TRICKS&mdash;THE TWO CHARACTERS&mdash;THE
JOCKEY&rsquo;S SONG</p>
<p>The jockey, having taken off his coat and advanced towards me,
as I have stated in the preceding chapter, exclaimed, in an angry
tone, &lsquo;This is the third time you have interrupted me in my
tale, Mr. Rye; I passed over the two first times with a simple
warning, but you will now please to get up and give me the
satisfaction of a man.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>&lsquo;I am really sorry,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if I
have given you offence, but you were talking of our English habit
of bestowing nicknames, and I could not refrain from giving a few
examples tending to prove what a very ancient habit it
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you interrupted me,&rsquo; said the jockey,
&lsquo;and put me out of my tale, which you had no right to do;
and as for your examples, how do you know that I wasn&rsquo;t
going to give some as old or older than yourn.&nbsp; Now stand
up, and I&rsquo;ll make an example of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I confess it was wrong in
me to interrupt you, and I ask your pardon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said the jockey,
&lsquo;asking pardon won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said I, getting up, &lsquo;if asking pardon
does not satisfy you, you are a different man from what I
considered you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But here the Hungarian, also getting up, interposed his tall
form and pipe between us, saying in English, scarcely
intelligible, &lsquo;Let there be no dispute!&nbsp; As for
myself, I am very much obliged to the young man of Horncastle for
his interruption, though he has told me that one of his dirty
townsmen called me &ldquo;Long-stockings.&rdquo;&nbsp; By Isten!
there is more learning in what he has just said, than in all the
verdammt English histories of Thor and Tzernebock I ever
read.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I care nothing for his learning,&rsquo; said the
jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;I consider myself as good a man as he, for
all his learning; so stand out of the way, Mr. Sixfoot-eleven,
or&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall do no such thing,&rsquo; said the
Hungarian.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder you are not ashamed of
yourself.&nbsp; You ask young man to drink champagne with you,
you make him dronk, he interrupt you with very good sense; he ask
your pardon, yet you not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;I am
satisfied.&nbsp; I am rather a short-tempered person, but I bear
no malice.&nbsp; He is, as you say, drinking my wine, and has
perhaps taken a drop too much, not being used to such high
liquor; but one doesn&rsquo;t like to be put out of one&rsquo;s
tale, more especially when one was about to moralize, do you see,
oneself, and to show off what little learning one has.&nbsp;
However, I bears no malice.&nbsp; Here is a hand to each of you:
we&rsquo;ll take another glass each, and think no more about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The jockey having shaken both of our hands, and filled <!--
page 269--><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>our glasses and his own with what champagne remained in
the bottle, put on his coat, sat down, and resumed his pipe and
story.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was I?&nbsp; Oh, roaming about the country with
Hopping Ned and Biting Giles.&nbsp; Those were happy days, and a
merry and prosperous life we led.&nbsp; However, nothing
continues under the sun in the same state in which it begins, and
our firm was soon destined to undergo a change.&nbsp; We came to
a village where there was a very high church steeple, and in a
little time my comrades induced a crowd of people to go and see
me display my gift by flinging stones above the heads of Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John, who stood at the four corners on the top,
carved in stone.&nbsp; The parson, seeing the crowd, came
waddling out of his rectory to see what was going on.&nbsp; After
I had flung up the stones, letting them fall just were I
liked&mdash;and one, I remember, fell on the head of Mark, where
I dare say it remains to the present day&mdash;the parson, who
was one of the description of people called philosophers, held up
his hand, and asked me to let the next stone I flung up fall into
it.&nbsp; He wished, do you see, to know with what weight the
stone would fall down, and talked something about
gravitation&mdash;a word which I could never understand to the
present day, save that it turned out a grave matter to me.&nbsp;
I, like a silly fellow myself, must needs consent, and, flinging
the stone up to a vast height, contrived so that it fell into the
parson&rsquo;s hand, which it cut dreadfully.&nbsp; The parson
flew into a great rage, more particularly as everybody laughed at
him, and, being a magistrate, ordered his clerk, who was likewise
constable, to conduct me to prison as a rogue and a vagabond,
telling my comrades that if they did not take themselves off, he
would serve them in the same manner.&nbsp; So Ned hopped off, and
Giles ran after him, without making any gathering, and I was led
to Bridewell, my mittimus following at the end of a week, the
parson&rsquo;s hand not permitting him to write before that
time.&nbsp; In the Bridewell I remained a month, when, being
dismissed, I went in quest of my companions, whom, after some
time, I found up, but they refused to keep my company any longer;
telling me that I was a dangerous character, likely to bring them
more trouble than profit; they had, moreover, filled up my
place.&nbsp; Going into a cottage to ask for a drink of water,
they saw a country fellow making faces <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>to amuse
his children; the faces were so wonderful that Hopping Ned and
Biting Giles at once proposed taking him into partnership, and
the man&mdash;who was a fellow not very fond of work&mdash;after
a little entreaty, went away with them.&nbsp; I saw him exhibit
his gift, and couldn&rsquo;t blame the others for preferring him
to me; he was a proper ugly fellow at all times, but when he made
faces his countenance was like nothing human.&nbsp; He was called
Ugly Moses.&nbsp; I was so amazed at his faces, that though poor
myself I gave him sixpence, which I have never grudged to this
day, for I never saw anything like them.&nbsp; The firm throve
wonderfully after he had been admitted into it.&nbsp; He died
some little time ago, keeper of a public-house, which he had been
enabled to take from the profits of his faces.&nbsp; A son of
his, one of the children he was making faces to when my comrades
entered his door, is at present a barrister, and a very rising
one.&nbsp; He has his gift&mdash;he has not, it is true, the gift
of the gab, but he has something better, he was born with a grin
on his face, a quiet grin; he would not have done to grin through
a collar like his father, and would never have been taken up by
Hopping Ned and Biting Giles, but that grin of his caused him to
be noticed by a much greater person than either; an attorney
observing it took a liking to the lad, and prophesied that he
would some day be heard of in the world; and in order to give him
the first lift, took him into his office, at first to light fires
and do such kind of work, and after a little time taught him to
write, then promoted him to a desk, articled him afterwards, and
being unmarried and without children, left him what he had when
he died.&nbsp; The young fellow, after practising at the law some
time, went to the bar, where, in a few years, helped on by his
grin, for he had nothing else to recommend him, he became, as I
said before, a rising barrister.&nbsp; He comes our circuit, and
I occasionally employ him, when I am obliged to go to law about
such a thing as an unsound horse.&nbsp; He generally brings me
through&mdash;or rather that grin of his does&mdash;and yet I
don&rsquo;t like the fellow, confound him, but I&rsquo;m an
oddity; no, the one I like, and whom I generally employ, is a
fellow quite different, a bluff sturdy dog, with no grin on his
face, but with a look which seems to say I am an honest man, and
what cares I for anyone.&nbsp; And an honest man he is, and
something more.&nbsp; I have known coves with a better gift of
the gab, <!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>though not many, but he always
speaks to the purpose, and understands law thoroughly; and
that&rsquo;s not all.&nbsp; When at college, for he has been at
college, he carried off everything before him as a Latiner, and
was first-rate at a game they called matthew mattocks.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is, but I have heard that he who
is first-rate at matthew mattocks <a name="citation271"></a><a
href="#footnote271" class="citation">[271]</a> is thought more of
than if he were first-rate Latiner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the chap that I&rsquo;m talking about, not only
came out first-rate Latiner, but first-rate at matthew mattocks
too; doing, in fact, as I am told by those who knows, for I was
never at college myself, what no one had ever done before.&nbsp;
Well, he makes his appearance at our circuit, does very well, of
course, but he has a somewhat high front, as becomes an honest
man, and one who has beat every one at Latin and matthew
mattocks; and who can speak first-rate law and sense;&mdash;but
see now, the cove with the grin, who has like myself never been
at college; knows nothing of Latin, or matthew mattocks, and has
no particular gift of the gab, has two briefs for his one, and I
suppose very properly, for that grin of his curries favour with
the juries; and mark me, that grin of his will enable him to beat
the other in the long run.&nbsp; We all know what all barrister
coves looks forward to&mdash;a seat on the hop sack.&nbsp; Well,
I&rsquo;ll bet a bull to fivepence, that the grinner gets upon
it, and the snarler doesn&rsquo;t; at any rate, that he gets
there first.&nbsp; I calls my cove&mdash;for he is my
cove&mdash;a snarler; because your first-rates at matthew
mattocks are called snarlers, and for no other reason; for the
chap, though with a high front, is a good chap, and once drank a
glass of ale with me, after buying an animal out of my
stable.&nbsp; I have often thought it a pity that he wasn&rsquo;t
born with a grin on his face, like the son of Ugly
<i>Moses</i>.&nbsp; It is true he would scarcely then have been
an out and outer at Latin and matthew mattocks, but what need of
either to a chap born with a grin?&nbsp; Talk of being born with
a silver spoon in one&rsquo;s mouth; give me a cove born with a
grin on his face&mdash;a much better endowment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will now shorten my history as much as I can, for we
have talked as much as folks do during a whole night in the
Commons&rsquo; House, though, of course, not with so much
learning, or so much to the purpose, because&mdash;why?&nbsp;
They are in the House of Commons, and we in a public <!-- page
272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>room of an inn at Horncastle.&nbsp; The goodness of the
ale do you see, never depending on what it is made of, oh, no!
but on the fashion and appearance of the jug in which it is
served up.&nbsp; After being turned out of the firm, I got my
living in two or three honest ways, which I shall not trouble you
with describing.&nbsp; I did not like any of them, however, as
they did not exactly suit my humour; at last I found one which
did.&nbsp; One Saturday forenoon I chanced to be in the
cattle-market of a place about eighty miles from here; there I
won the favour of an old gentleman who sold dickeys.&nbsp; He had
a very shabby squad of animals, without soul or spirit; nobody
would buy them, till I leaped upon their hinder ends, and by
merely wriggling in a particular manner, made them caper and
bound so to people&rsquo;s liking, that in a few hours every one
of them was sold at very sufficient prices.&nbsp; The old
gentleman was so pleased with my skill, that he took me home with
him, and in a very little time into partnership.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a good thing to have a gift, but yet better to have two.&nbsp; I
might have got a very decent livelihood by throwing stones, but I
much question whether I should ever have attained to the position
in society which I now occupy, but for my knowledge of
animals.&nbsp; I lived very comfortably with the old gentleman
till he died, which he did about a fortnight after he had laid
his old lady in the ground.&nbsp; Having no children, he left me
what should remain after he had been buried decently, and the
remainder was six dickeys and thirty shillings in silver.&nbsp; I
remained in the dickey trade ten years, during which time I saved
a hundred pounds.&nbsp; I then embarked in the horse line.&nbsp;
One day, being in the --- market on a Saturday, I saw Mary
Fulcher with a halter round her neck, led about by a man, who
offered to sell her for eighteenpence.&nbsp; I took out the money
forthwith and bought her; the man was her husband, a
basket-maker, with whom she had lived several years without
having any children; he was a drunken, quarrelsome fellow, and
having had a dispute with her the day before, he determined to
get rid of her, by putting a halter round her neck, and leading
her to the cattle-market, as if she were a mare, which he had, it
seems, a right to do; all women being considered mares by old
English law, and, indeed, still called mares in certain counties,
where genuine old English is still preserved.&nbsp; That same
afternoon, the <!-- page 273--><a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>man who had been her husband, having
got drunk in a public-house with the money which he had received
for her, quarrelled with another man, and receiving a blow under
the ear, fell upon the floor, and died of artiflex; and in less
than three weeks I was married to Mary Fulcher, by virtue of
regular bans.&nbsp; I am told she was legally my property by
virtue of my having bought her with a halter round her neck; but,
to tell you the truth, I think everybody should live by his
trade, and I didn&rsquo;t wish to act shabbily towards our
parson, who is a good fellow, and has certainly a right to his
fees.&nbsp; A better wife than Mary Fulcher&mdash;I mean Mary
Dale&mdash;no one ever had; she has borne me several children,
and has at all times shown a willingness to oblige me, and to be
my faithful wife.&nbsp; Amongst other things, I begged her to
have done with her family, and I believe she has never spoken to
them since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thriven very well in business, and my name is up
as being a person who can be depended on, when folks treats me
handsomely.&nbsp; I always makes a point when a gentleman comes
to me, and says, &ldquo;Mr. Dale,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;John&rdquo;&mdash;for I have no objection to be called
John by a gentleman&mdash;&ldquo;I wants a good horse, and I am
ready to pay a good price&rdquo;&mdash;I always makes a point, I
say, to furnish him with an animal worth the money; but when I
sees a fellow, whether he calls himself gentleman or not, wishing
to circumvent me, what does I do?&nbsp; I doesn&rsquo;t quarrel
with him, not I; but, letting him imagine he is taking me in, I
contrives to sell him a screw for thirty pounds, not worth forty
shillings.&nbsp; All honest respectable people have at present
great confidence in me, and frequently commissions me to buy them
horses at great fairs like this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This short young gentleman was recommended to me by a
great landed proprietor, to whom he bore letters of
recommendation from some great prince in his own country, who had
a long time ago been entertained at the house of the landed
proprietor, and the consequence is, that I brings young six foot
six to Horncastle, and purchases for him the horse of the Romany
Rye.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t do these kind things for nothing, it is
true; that can&rsquo;t be expected; for every one must live by
his trade; but, as I said before, when I am treated handsomely, I
treat folks so.&nbsp; Honesty, I have discovered, as perhaps some
other <!-- page 274--><a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>people have, is by far the best
policy; though, as I also said before, when I&rsquo;m along with
thieves, I can beat them at their own game.&nbsp; If I am obliged
to do it, I can pass off the veriest screw as a flying
drummedary, for even when I was a child I had found out by
various means what may be done with animals.&nbsp; I wish now to
ask a civil question, Mr. Romany Rye.&nbsp; Certain folks have
told me that you are a horse witch, are you one, or are you
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I, like yourself,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;know, to a
certain extent, what may be done with animals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then how would you, Mr. Romany Rye, pass off the
veriest screw in the world for a flying drummedary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By putting a small live eel down his throat; as long as
the eel remained in his stomach, the horse would appear brisk and
lively in a surprising degree.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how would you contrive to make a regular kicker and
biter appear so tame and gentle, that any respectable fat old
gentleman of sixty, who wanted an easy goer, would be glad to
purchase him for fifty pounds?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By pouring down his throat four pints of generous old
ale, which would make him so happy and comfortable, that he would
not have the heart to kick or bite anybody, for a season at
least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And where did you learn all this?&rsquo; said the
jockey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read about the eel in an old English book, and
about the making drunk in a Spanish novel, and, singularly
enough, I was told the same things by a wild blacksmith in
Ireland.&nbsp; Now tell me, do you bewitch horses in this
way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I?&rsquo; said the jockey; &lsquo;mercy upon us!&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t do such things for a hatful of money.&nbsp; No,
no, preserve me from live eels and hocussing!&nbsp; And now let
me ask you, how you would spirit a horse out of a
field?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How would I spirit a horse out of a field?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! supposing you were down in the world, and had
determined on taking up the horse-stealing line of
business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why I should&mdash;.&nbsp; But I tell you what, friend,
I see you are trying to pump me, and I tell you plainly that I
will hear something from you with respect to your art, before I
tell you anything more.&nbsp; Now, how would you whisper a horse
out of a field, provided you were down in the world, and so
forth?&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>&lsquo;Ah, ah, I see you are up to game, Mr. Romany:
however, I am a gentleman in mind, if not by birth, and I scorn
to do the unhandsome thing to anybody who has dealt fairly
towards me.&nbsp; Now, you told me something I didn&rsquo;t know,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you something which perhaps you do
know.&nbsp; I whispers a horse out of a field in this way: I have
a mare in my stable; well, in the early season of the year I goes
into my stable&mdash;Well, I puts the sponge into a small bottle
which I keeps corked.&nbsp; I takes my bottle in my hand, and
goes into a field, suppose by night, where there is a very fine
stag horse.&nbsp; I manage with great difficulty to get within
ten yards of the horse, who stands staring at me just ready to
run away.&nbsp; I then uncorks my bottle, presses my fore-finger
to the sponge, and holds it out to the horse; the horse gives a
sniff, then a start, and comes nearer.&nbsp; I corks up my bottle
and puts it into my pocket.&nbsp; My business is done, for the
next two hours the horse would follow me anywhere&mdash;the
difficulty, indeed, would be to get rid of him.&nbsp; Now, is
that your way of doing business?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My way of doing business?&nbsp; Mercy upon us!&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t steal a horse in that way, or, indeed, in any way,
for all the money in the world: however, let me tell you, for
your comfort, that a trick somewhat similar is described in the
history of Herodotus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the history of Herod&rsquo;s ass!&rsquo; said the
jockey; &lsquo;well, if I did write a book, it should be about
something more genteel than a dickey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not say Herod&rsquo;s ass!&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;but Herodotus, a very genteel writer, I assure you, who
wrote a history about very genteel people, in a language no less
genteel than Greek, more than two thousand years ago.&nbsp; There
was a dispute as to who should be king amongst certain imperious
chieftains.&nbsp; At last they agreed to obey him whose horse
should neigh first on a certain day, in front of the royal
palace, before the rising of the sun; for you must know that they
did not worship the person who made the sun as we do, but the sun
itself.&nbsp; So one of these chieftains, talking over the matter
to his groom, and saying he wondered who would be king, the
fellow said, &ldquo;Why, you, master, or I don&rsquo;t know much
about horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the day before the day of trial,
what does the groom do but take his master&rsquo;s horse before
the palace and introduce him to a mare in the stable, and <!--
page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>then lead him forth again.&nbsp; Well, early the next
day all the chieftains on their horses appeared in front of the
palace before the dawn of day.&nbsp; Not a horse neighed but one,
and that was the horse of him who had consulted with his groom,
who, thinking of the animal within the stable, gave such a neigh
that all the buildings rang.&nbsp; His rider was forthwith
elected king, and a brave king he was.&nbsp; So this shows what
seemingly wonderful things may be brought about by a little
preparation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It doth,&rsquo; said the jockey; &lsquo;what was the
chap&rsquo;s name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His name&mdash;his name&mdash;Darius
Hystaspes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the groom&rsquo;s?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he made a good king?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;First-rate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only think! well, if he made a good king, what a
wonderful king the groom would have made, through whose knowledge
of &rsquo;orses he was put on the throne.&nbsp; And now another
question, Mr. Romany Rye, have you particular words which have
power to soothe or aggravate horses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should ask me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;whether I have
horses that can be aggravated or soothed by particular
words.&nbsp; No words have any particular power over horses or
other animals who have never heard them before&mdash;how should
they?&nbsp; But certain animals connect ideas of misery or
enjoyment with particular words which they are acquainted
with.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you an example.&nbsp; I knew a cob in
Ireland that could be driven to a state of kicking madness by a
particular word, used by a particular person, in a particular
tone; but that word was connected with a very painful operation
which had been performed upon him by that individual, who had
frequently employed it at a certain period whilst the animal had
been under his treatment.&nbsp; The same cob could be soothed in
a moment by another word, used by the same individual in a very
different kind of tone&mdash;the word was deaghblasda, or sweet
tasted.&nbsp; Some time after the operation, whilst the cob was
yet under his hands, the fellow&mdash;who was what the Irish call
a fairy smith&mdash;had done all he could to soothe the creature,
and had at last succeeded by giving it gingerbread-buttons, of
which the cob became passionately fond.&nbsp; Invariably,
however, before giving it a button, he said, <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>&ldquo;Deaghblasda,&rdquo; with which word the cob by
degrees associated an idea of unmixed enjoyment: so if he could
rouse the cob to madness by the word which recalled the torture
to its remembrance, he could as easily soothe it by the other
word, which the cob knew would be instantly followed by the
button, which the smith never failed to give him after using the
word deaghblasda.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing wonderful to be done,&rsquo; said the
jockey, &lsquo;without a good deal of preparation, as I know
myself.&nbsp; Folks stare and wonder at certain things which they
would only laugh at if they knew how they were done; and to prove
what I say is true, I will give you one or two examples.&nbsp;
Can either of you lend me a handkerchief?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t
do,&rsquo; said he, as I presented him with a silk one.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I wish for a delicate white handkerchief.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s just the kind of thing,&rsquo; said he, as the
Hungarian offered him a fine white cambric handkerchief,
beautifully worked with gold at the hems; &lsquo;now you shall
see me set this handkerchief on fire.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him do so by any means,&rsquo; said the
Hungarian, speaking to me in German, &lsquo;it is the gift of a
lady whom I highly admire, and I would not have it burnt for the
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He has no occasion to be under any
apprehension,&rsquo; said the jockey, after I had interpreted to
him what the Hungarian had said, &lsquo;I will restore it to him
uninjured, or my name is not Jack Dale.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
sticking the handkerchief carelessly into the left side of his
bosom, he took the candle, which by this time had burnt very low,
and holding his head back, he applied the flame to the
handkerchief, which instantly seemed to catch fire.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you think of that?&rsquo; said he to the
Hungarian.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, that you have ruined me,&rsquo; said
the latter.&nbsp; &lsquo;No harm done, I assure you,&rsquo; said
the jockey, who presently, clapping his hand on his bosom,
extinguished the fire, and returned the handkerchief to the
Hungarian, asking him if it was burnt.&nbsp; &lsquo;I see no burn
upon it,&rsquo; said the Hungarian; &lsquo;but in the name of
Gott how could you set it on fire without burning
it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I never set it on fire at all,&rsquo;
said the jockey; &lsquo;I set this on fire,&rsquo; showing us a
piece of half-burnt calico.&nbsp; &lsquo;I placed this calico
above it, and lighted not the handkerchief, but the rag.&nbsp;
Now, I will show you something else.&nbsp; I have a magic
shilling in my pocket, which I can make run up <!-- page 278--><a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>along my
arm.&nbsp; But, first of all, I would gladly know whether either
of you can do the like.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon the Hungarian and
myself, putting our hands into our pockets, took out shillings,
and endeavoured to make them run up our arms, but utterly failed;
both shillings, after we had made two or three attempts, falling
to the ground.&nbsp; &lsquo;What noncomposses you both
are,&rsquo; said the jockey; and, placing a shilling on the end
of the fingers of his right hand, he made strange faces to it,
drawing back his head, whereupon the shilling instantly began to
run up his arm, occasionally hopping and jumping as if it were
bewitched, always endeavouring to make towards the head of the
jockey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do I do that?&rsquo; said he, addressing himself to
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;I really do not know,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;unless it is by the motion of your arm.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;The motion of my nonsense,&rsquo; said the jockey, and,
making a dreadful grimace, the shilling hopped upon his knee, and
began to run up his thigh and to climb his breast.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How is that done?&rsquo; said he again.&nbsp; &lsquo;By
witchcraft, I suppose,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;There you are
right,&rsquo; said the jockey; &lsquo;by the withcraft of one of
Miss Berners&rsquo; hairs; the end of one of her long hairs is
tied to that shilling by means of a hole in it, and the other end
goes round my neck by means of a loop; so that, when I draw back
my head, the shilling follows it.&nbsp; I suppose you wish to
know how I got the hair,&rsquo; said he, grinning at me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will tell you.&nbsp; I once, in the course of my
ridings, saw Miss Berners beneath a hedge, combing out her long
hair, and, being rather a modest kind of person, what must I do
but get off my horse, tie him to a gate, go up to her, and
endeavour to enter into conversation with her.&nbsp; After giving
her the sele of the day, and complimenting her on her hair, I
asked her to give me one of the threads; whereupon she gave me
such a look, and, calling me fellow, told me to take myself
off.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must have a hair first,&rdquo; said I, making
a snatch at one.&nbsp; I believe I hurt her; but, whether I did
or not, up she started, and, though her hair was unbound, gave me
the only drubbing I ever had in my life.&nbsp; Lor! how, with her
right hand, she fibbed me whilst she held me round the neck with
her left arm; I was soon glad to beg her pardon on my knees,
which she gave me in a moment when she saw me in that condition,
being the most placable creature in the world, and not only her
pardon, <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>but one of the hairs which I longed
for, which I put through a shilling, with which I have on
evenings after fairs, like this, frequently worked what seemed to
those who looked on downright witchcraft, but which is nothing
more than pleasant deception.&nbsp; And now, Mr. Romany Rye, to
testify my regard for you, I give you the shilling and the
hair.&nbsp; I think you have a kind of respect for Miss Berners;
but whether you have or not, keep them as long as you can, and
whenever you look at them think of the finest woman in England,
and of John Dale, the jockey of Horncastle.&nbsp; I believe I
have told you my history,&rsquo; said he&mdash;&lsquo;no, not
quite; there is one circumstance I had passed over.&nbsp; I told
you that I have thriven very well in business, and so I have upon
the whole: at any rate, I find myself comfortably off now.&nbsp;
I have horses, money, and owe nobody a groat; at any rate,
nothing but what I could pay to-morrow.&nbsp; Yet I have had my
dreary day, ay, after I had obtained what I call a station in the
world.&nbsp; All of a sudden, about five years ago, everything
seemed to go wrong with me&mdash;horses became sick or died,
people who owed me money broke or ran away, my house caught fire,
in fact, everything went against me; and not from any
mismanagement of my own.&nbsp; I looked round for help,
but&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;nobody would help me.&nbsp;
Somehow or other it had got abroad that I was in difficulties,
and everybody seemed disposed to avoid me, as if I had got the
plague.&nbsp; Those who were always offering me help when I
wanted none, now, when they thought me in trouble, talked of
arresting me.&nbsp; Yes, two particular friends of mine, who had
always been offering me their purses when my own was stuffed
full, now talked of arresting me, though I only owed the
scoundrels a hundred pounds each; and they would have done so,
provided I had not paid them what I owed them; and how did I do
that?&nbsp; Why, I was able to do it because I found a
friend&mdash;and who was that friend?&nbsp; Why, a man who has
since been hung, of whom everybody has heard, and of whom
everybody for the next hundred years will occasionally talk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day, whilst in trouble, I was visited by a person
<a name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279"
class="citation">[279]</a> I had occasionally met at sporting
dinners.&nbsp; He came to look after a Suffolk Punch, the best
horse, by-the-by, that <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>anybody can
purchase to drive, it being the only animal of the horse kind in
England that will pull twice at a dead weight.&nbsp; I told him
that I had none at that time that I could recommend; in fact,
that every horse in my stable was sick.&nbsp; He then invited me
to dine with him at an inn close by, and I was glad to go with
him, in the hope of getting rid of unpleasant thoughts.&nbsp;
After dinner, during which he talked nothing but slang, observing
I looked melancholy, he asked me what was the matter with me, and
I, my heart being opened by the wine he had made me drink, told
him my circumstances without reserve.&nbsp; With an oath or two
for not having treated him at first like a friend, he said he
would soon set me all right; and pulling out two hundred pounds,
told me to pay him when I could.&nbsp; I felt as I never felt
before; however, I took his notes, paid my sneaks, and in less
than three months was right again, and had returned him his
money.&nbsp; On paying it to him, I said that I had now a Punch
which would just suit him, saying that I would give it to
him&mdash;a free gift&mdash;for nothing.&nbsp; He swore at me;
telling me to keep my Punch, for that he was suited
already.&nbsp; I begged him to tell me how I could requite him
for his kindness, whereupon, with the most dreadful oath I ever
heard, he bade me come and see him hanged when his time was
come.&nbsp; I wrung his hand, and told him I would, and I kept my
word.&nbsp; The night before the day he was hanged at H---, <a
name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280"
class="citation">[280]</a> I harnessed a Suffolk Punch to my
light gig, the same Punch which I had offered to him, which I
have ever since kept, and which brought me and this short young
man to Horncastle, and in eleven hours I drove that Punch one
hundred and ten miles.&nbsp; I arrived at H--- just in the nick
of time.&nbsp; There was the ugly jail&mdash;the
scaffold&mdash;and there upon it stood the only friend I ever had
in the world.&nbsp; Driving my Punch, which was all in a foam,
into the midst of the crowd, which made way for me as if it knew
what I came for, I stood up in my gig, took off my hat, and
shouted, &ldquo;God Almighty bless you, Jack!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
dying man turned his pale grim face towards me&mdash;for his face
was always somewhat grim, do you see&mdash;nodded and said, or I
thought I heard him say, &ldquo;All right, old chap.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The next moment . . . my eyes water.&nbsp; He had a high heart,
got into a scrape whilst in the marines, lost his half-pay, took
to the turf, ring, <!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>gambling, and at last cut the throat
of a villain who had robbed him of nearly all he had.&nbsp; But
he had good qualities, and I know for certain that he never did
half the bad things laid to his charge; for example, he never
bribed Tom Oliver to fight cross, as it was said he did, on the
day of the awful thunderstorm. <a name="citation281a"></a><a
href="#footnote281a" class="citation">[281a]</a>&nbsp; Ned
Flatnose fairly beat Tom Oliver, for though Ned was not
what&rsquo;s called a good fighter, he had a particular blow,
which if he could put in he was sure to win.&nbsp; His right
shoulder, do you see, was two inches farther back than it ought
to have been, and consequently his right fist generally fell
short; but if he could swing himself round, and put in a blow
with that right arm, he could kill or take away the senses of
anybody in the world.&nbsp; It was by putting in that blow in his
second fight with Spring that he beat noble Tom.&nbsp; Spring
beat him like a sack in the first battle, but in the second Ned
Painter&mdash;for that was his real name&mdash;contrived to put
in his blow, and took the senses out of Spring; and in like
manner he took the senses out of Tom Oliver.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, some are born to be hanged, and some are not; and
many of those who are not hanged are much worse than those who
are.&nbsp; Jack, with many a good quality, is hanged, whilst that
fellow of a lord, who wanted to get the horse from you at about
two-thirds of his value, without a single good quality in the
world, is not hanged, and probably will remain so.&nbsp; You ask
the reason why, perhaps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you; the lack of a
certain quality called courage, which Jack possessed in
abundance, will preserve him; from the love which he bears his
own neck he will do nothing which can bring him to the gallows.
<a name="citation281b"></a><a href="#footnote281b"
class="citation">[281b]</a>&nbsp; In my rough way I&rsquo;ll draw
their characters from their childhood, and then ask whether Jack
was not the best character of the two.&nbsp; Jack was a rough,
audacious boy, fond of fighting, going a birds&rsquo;-nesting,
but I never heard he did anything particularly cruel save once, I
believe, tying a canister to a butcher&rsquo;s dog&rsquo;s tail;
whilst this fellow of a lord was by nature a savage beast, <!--
page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>and when a boy would in winter pluck poor fowls naked,
and set them running on the ice and in the snow, and was
particularly fond of burning cats alive in the fire.&nbsp; Jack,
when a lad, gets a commission on board a ship as an officer of
horse marines, and in two or three engagements behaves quite up
to the mark&mdash;at least of a marine; the marines having no
particular character for courage you know&mdash;never having run
to the guns and fired them like madmen after the blue jackets had
had more than enough.&nbsp; Oh, dear me, no!&nbsp; My lord gets
into the valorous British army, where cowardice&mdash;oh, dear
me!&mdash;is a thing almost entirely unknown; and being on the
field of Waterloo the day before the battle, falls off his horse,
and, pretending to be hurt in the back, gets himself put on the
sick list&mdash;a pretty excuse&mdash;hurting his back&mdash;for
not being present at such a fight.&nbsp; Old Benbow, after part
of both his legs had been shot away in a sea-fight, made the
carpenter make him a cradle to hold his bloody stumps, and
continued on deck cheering his men till he died.&nbsp; Jack
returns home, and gets into trouble, and having nothing to
subsist by but his wits, gets his living by the ring, and the
turf, and gambling, doing many an odd kind of thing, I dare say,
but not half those laid to his charge.&nbsp; My lord does much
the same without the excuse for doing so which Jack had, for he
had plenty of means, is a leg, and a black, only in a more
polished way, and with more cunning, and I may say success,
having done many a rascally thing never laid to his charge.&nbsp;
Jack at last cuts the throat of a villain who had cheated him of
all he had in the world, and who, I am told, was in many points
the counterpart of this screw and white feather, is taken up,
tried, and executed; and certainly taking away a man&rsquo;s life
is a dreadful thing; but is there nothing as bad?&nbsp;
Whitefeather will cut no person&rsquo;s throat&mdash;I will not
say who has cheated him, for, being a cheat himself, he will take
good care that nobody cheats him, but he&rsquo;ll do something
quite as bad; out of envy to a person who never injured him, and
whom he hates for being more clever and respected than himself,
he will do all he possibly can, by backbiting and every unfair
means, to do that person a mortal injury.&nbsp; But Jack is
hanged, and my lord is not.&nbsp; Is that right?&nbsp; My wife,
Mary Fulcher&mdash;I beg her pardon, Mary Dale&mdash;who is a
Methodist, and has heard the mighty preacher, Peter Williams,
says <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>some people are preserved from
hanging by the grace of God.&nbsp; With her I differs, and says
it is from want of courage.&nbsp; This Whitefeather, with one
particle of Jack&rsquo;s courage, and with one tithe of his good
qualities, would have been hanged long ago, for he has ten times
Jack&rsquo;s malignity.&nbsp; Jack was hanged because, along with
his bad qualities, he had courage and generosity; this fellow is
not, because with all Jack&rsquo;s bad qualities, and many more,
amongst which is cunning, he has neither courage nor
generosity.&nbsp; Think of a fellow like that putting down two
hundred pounds to relieve a distressed fellow-creature; why he
would rob, but for the law and the fear it fills him with, a
workhouse child of its breakfast, as the saying is&mdash;and has
been heard to say that he would not trust his own father for
sixpence, and he can&rsquo;t imagine why such a thing as credit
should be ever given.&nbsp; I never heard a person give him a
good word&mdash;stay, stay, yes! I once heard an old parson, to
whom I sold a Punch, say that he had the art of receiving company
gracefully, and dismissing them without refreshment.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t wish to be too hard with him, and so let him make the
most of that compliment.&nbsp; Well! he manages to get on, whilst
Jack is hanged; not quite enviably, however; he has had his rubs,
and pretty hard ones&mdash;everybody knows he slunk from
Waterloo, and occasionally checks him with so doing; whilst he
has been rejected by a woman&mdash;what a mortification to the
low pride of which the scoundrel has plenty!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
a song about both circumstances, which may, perhaps, ring in his
ears on a dying bed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a funny kind of song, set
to the old tune of the Lord-Lieutenant or Deputy, and with it I
will conclude my discourse, for I really think it&rsquo;s past
one.&rsquo;&nbsp; The jockey then, with a very tolerable voice,
sung the following song:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE JOCKEY&rsquo;S SONG.</p>
<p>Now list to a ditty both funny and true!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
A ditty that tells of a coward and screw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>Sir Plume, though not liking a bullet at all&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
Had yet resolution to go to a <i>ball</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p><!-- page 284--><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>&lsquo;Woulez wous danser,
mademoiselle?&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
Said she, &lsquo;Sir, to dance I should like very well,&rsquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>They danc&rsquo;d to the left, and they danc&rsquo;d to the
right&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
And her troth the fair damsel bestow&rsquo;d on the knight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now what shall I fetch you
mademoiselle?&rsquo;<i>&mdash;</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
Said she, &lsquo;Sir, an ice I should like very well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>But the ice, when he&rsquo;d got it, he instantly
ate&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
Although his pool partner was all in a fret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>He ate up the ice like a prudent young lord&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
For he saw &rsquo;twas the very last ice on the board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now when shall we marry?&rsquo; the gentleman
cried&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Sir, get you to Jordan,&rsquo; the damsel replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never will wed with the pitiful elf&rsquo;&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;Who ate up the ice which I wanted myself,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d pardon your backing from red
Waterloo,&rsquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;But I never will wed with a coward and screw,&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<p>THE CHURCH</p>
<p>The next morning I began to think of departing: I had sewed up
the money which I had received for the horse in a portion of my
clothing, where I entertained no fears for its safety, with the
exception of a small sum in notes, gold, and silver, which I
carried in my pocket.&nbsp; Ere departing, however, I determined
to stroll about and examine <!-- page 285--><a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>the town,
and observe more particularly the humours of the fair than I had
hitherto an opportunity of doing.&nbsp; The town, when I examined
it, offered no object worthy of attention but its church&mdash;an
edifice of some antiquity; under the guidance of an old man, who
officiated as sexton, I inspected its interior attentively,
occasionally conversing with my guide, who, however, seemed much
more disposed to talk about horses than the church.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No good horses in the fair this time, measter,&rsquo; said
he; &lsquo;none but one brought hither by a chap whom nobody
knows, and bought by a foreigneering man, who came here with Jack
Dale.&nbsp; The horse fetched a good swinging price, which is
said, however, to be much less than its worth; for the horse is a
regular clipper; not such a one, &rsquo;tis said, has been seen
in the fair for several summers.&nbsp; Lord Whitefeather says
that he believes the fellow who brought him to be a highwayman,
and talks of having him taken up, but Lord Whitefeather is only
in a rage because he could not get him for himself.&nbsp; The
chap would not sell it to un; Lord Screw wanted to beat him down,
and the chap took huff, said he wouldn&rsquo;t sell it to him at
no price, and accepted the offer of the foreigneering man, or of
Jack, who was his &rsquo;terpreter, and who scorned to higgle
about such an hanimal, because Jack is a gentleman, though bred a
dickey-boy, whilst &rsquo;tother, though bred a lord, is a screw,
and a whitefeather.&nbsp; Every one says the cove was right, and
I says so too; I likes spirit, and if the cove were here, and in
your place, measter, I would invite him to drink a pint of
beer.&nbsp; Good horses are scarce now, measter, ay, and so are
good men, quite a different set from what there were when I was
young; that was the time for men and horses.&nbsp; Lord bless
you, I know all the breeders about here; they are not a bad set,
and they breed a very fairish set of horses, but they are not
like what their fathers were, nor are their horses like their
fathers&rsquo; horses.&nbsp; Now, there is Mr. ---, the great
breeder, a very fairish man, with very fairish horses; but, Lord
bless you, he&rsquo;s nothing to what his father was, nor his
steeds to his father&rsquo;s; I ought to know, for I was at the
school here with his father, and afterwards for many a year
helped him to get up his horses; that was when I was young,
measter&mdash;those were the days.&nbsp; You look at that
monument, measter,&rsquo; said he, as I stopped and looked
attentively at a monument on the southern side of the church near
the altar; &lsquo;that was put up for a rector of this church,
who lived a long time ago, in Oliver&rsquo;s time, and <!-- page
286--><a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>was ill-treated and imprisoned by Oliver and his men;
you will see all about it on the monument.&nbsp; There was a
grand battle fought nigh this place, between Oliver&rsquo;s men
and the Royal party, and the Royal party had the worst of it, as
I&rsquo;m told they generally had; and Oliver&rsquo;s men came
into the town and did a great deal of damage, and ill-treated
people.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t remember anything about the matter
myself, for it happened just one hundred years before I was born,
but my father was acquainted with an old countryman, who lived
not many miles from here, who said he remembered perfectly well
the day of the battle; that he was a boy at the time, and was
working in a field near the place where the battle was fought;
and he heard shouting, and noise of firearms, and also the sound
of several balls, which fell in the field near him.&nbsp; Come
this way, measter, and I will show you some remains of that
day&rsquo;s field.&rsquo;&nbsp; Leaving the monument, on which
was inscribed an account of the life and sufferings of the
Royalist Rector of Horncastle, I followed the sexton to the
western end of the church, where, hanging against the wall, were
a number of scythes stuck in the ends of poles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Those are the weapons, measter,&rsquo; said the sexton,
&lsquo;which the great people put into the hands of a number of
the country folks, in order that they might use them against
Oliver&rsquo;s men; ugly weapons enough: however, Oliver&rsquo;s
men won, and Sir Jacob Ashley and his party were beat.&nbsp; And
a rare time Oliver and his men had of it, till Oliver died, when
the other party got the better, not by fighting, &rsquo;tis said,
but through a General Monk, who turned sides.&nbsp; Ah, the old
fellow that my father knew, said he well remembered the time when
General Monk went over and proclaimed Charles the Second.&nbsp;
Bonfires were lighted everywhere, oxen roasted, and beer drunk by
pailfuls; the country folks were drunk with joy, and something
else; sung scurvy songs about Oliver to the tune of Barney Banks,
and pelted his men, wherever they found them, with stones and
dirt.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The more ungrateful scoundrels
they,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oliver and his men fought the
battle of English independence against a wretched king and
corrupt lords.&nbsp; Had I been living at the time, I should have
been proud to be a trooper of Oliver.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You
would, measter, would you?&nbsp; Well, I never quarrels with the
opinions of people who come to look at the church, and certainly
independence is a fine thing.&nbsp; I like to see a chap of an
independent spirit, and if I were now to see the cove who refused
to sell his horse to <!-- page 287--><a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>my Lord Screw and Whitefeather, and
let Jack Dale have him, I would offer to treat him to a pint of
beer&mdash;e&rsquo;es I would, verily.&nbsp; Well, measter, you
have now seen the church, and all there&rsquo;s in it worth
seeing&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll just lock up, and go and finish
digging the grave I was about when you came, after which I must
go into the fair to see how matters are going on.&nbsp; Thank ye,
measter,&rsquo; said he, as I put something into his hand;
&lsquo;thank ye kindly; &rsquo;tis not every one gives me a
shilling nowadays who comes to see the church, but times are very
different from what they were when I was young; I was not sexton
then, but something better; helped Mr. --- with his horses, and
got many a broad crown.&nbsp; Those were the days, measter, both
for men and horses&mdash;and I say, measter, if men and horses
were so much better when I was young than they are now, what, I
wonder, must they have been in the time of Oliver and his
men?&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<p>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</p>
<p>Leaving the church, I strolled through the fair, looking at
the horses, listening to the chaffering of the buyers and
sellers, and occasionally putting in a word of my own, which was
not always received with much deference; suddenly, however, on a
whisper arising that I was the young cove who had brought the
wonderful horse to the fair which Jack Dale had bought for the
foreigneering man, I found myself an object of the greatest
attention; those who had before replied with stuff! and nonsense!
to what I said, now listened with the greatest eagerness to any
nonsense which I chose to utter, and I did not fail to utter a
great deal; presently, however, becoming disgusted with the
beings about me, I forced my way, not very civilly, through my
crowd of admirers; and passing through an alley and a back
street, at last reached an outskirt of the fair where no person
appeared to know me.&nbsp; Here I stood, looking vacantly on what
was going on, musing on the strange infatuation of my species,
who judge of a person&rsquo;s words, not from their intrinsic
merit, but from the opinion&mdash;generally an erroneous
one&mdash;which they have formed of the person.&nbsp; From this
reverie I was roused by certain words which sounded near me,
uttered in a strange tone, and in a strange <!-- page 288--><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>cadence&mdash;the words were, &lsquo;them that finds,
wins; and them that can&rsquo;t finds, loses.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Turning my eyes in the direction from which the words proceeded,
I saw six or seven people, apparently all countrymen, gathered
round a person standing behind a tall white table of very small
compass.&nbsp; &lsquo;What,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;the
thimble-engro of --- Fair here at Horncastle.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Advancing nearer, however, I perceived that though the present
person was a thimble-engro, <a name="citation288a"></a><a
href="#footnote288a" class="citation">[288a]</a> he was a very
different one from my old acquaintance of --- Fair. <a
name="citation288b"></a><a href="#footnote288b"
class="citation">[288b]</a>&nbsp; The present one was a fellow
about half-a-foot taller than the other.&nbsp; He had a long,
haggard, wild face, and was dressed in a kind of jacket,
something like that of a soldier, with dirty hempen trousers, and
with a foreign-looking peaked hat on his head.&nbsp; He spoke
with an accent evidently Irish, and occasionally changed the
usual thimble formula into &lsquo;them that finds wins, and them
that can&rsquo;t&mdash;och sure!&mdash;they loses;&rsquo; saying
also frequently &lsquo;your honour&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;my
lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; I observed, on drawing nearer, that he handled
the pea and thimble with some awkwardness, like that which might
be expected from a novice in the trade.&nbsp; He contrived,
however, to win several shillings, for he did not seem to play
for gold, from &lsquo;their honours.&rsquo;&nbsp; Awkward as he
was, he evidently did his best, and never flung a chance away by
permitting anyone to win.&nbsp; He had just won three shillings
from a farmer, who, incensed at his loss, was calling him a
confounded cheat, and saying that he would play no more, when up
came my friend of the preceding day, Jack the jockey.&nbsp; This
worthy, after looking at the thimble man a moment or two, with a
peculiarly crafty glance, cried out, as he clapped down a
shilling on the table, &lsquo;I will stand you, old
fellow!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Them that finds wins; and them that
can&rsquo;t&mdash;och, sure!&mdash;they loses,&rsquo; said the
thimble man.&nbsp; The game commenced, and Jack took up the
thimble without finding the pea; another shilling was produced,
and lost in the same manner.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is slow
work,&rsquo; said Jack, banging down a guinea on the table:
&lsquo;can you cover that, old fellow?&rsquo;&nbsp; The man of
the thimble looked at the gold, and then at him who produced it,
and scratched his head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, cover that, or I shall
be off,&rsquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &lsquo;Och, sure, my
lord!&mdash;no, I mean your honour&mdash;no, shure, your
lordship,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;if I covers it at all, it
must be with silver, for divil a bit of gold have I by
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, then, produce the value <!-- page
289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>in
silver,&rsquo; said the jockey, &lsquo;and do it quickly, for I
can&rsquo;t be staying here all day.&rsquo;&nbsp; The thimble man
hesitated, looked at Jack with a dubious look, then at the gold,
and then scratched his head.&nbsp; There was now a laugh amongst
the surrounders, which evidently nettled the fellow, who
forthwith thrust his hand into his pocket, and pulling out all
his silver treasure, just contrived to place the value of the
guinea on the table.&nbsp; &lsquo;Them that finds wins, and them
that can&rsquo;t finds&mdash;<i>loses</i>,&rsquo; interrupted
Jack, lifting up a thimble, out of which rolled a pea.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There, Paddy, what do you think of that?&rsquo; said he,
seizing the heap of silver with one hand, whilst he pocketed the
guinea with the other.&nbsp; The thimble-engro stood for some
time like one transfixed, his eyes glaring wildly, now at the
table, and now at his successful customer; at last he said,
&lsquo;Arrah, sure, master!&mdash;no, I manes my lord&mdash;you
are not going to ruin a poor boy!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ruin
you!&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;what! by winning a
guinea&rsquo;s change! a pretty small dodger you&mdash;if you
have not sufficient capital, why do you engage in so deep a trade
as thimbling? come, will you stand another game?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Och, sure, master, no! the twenty shillings and one which
you have cheated me of were all I had in the world.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Cheated you,&rsquo; said Jack, &lsquo;say that again and I
will knock you down.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Arrah! sure master, you
knows that the pea under the thimble was not mine; here is mine,
master; now give me back my money!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A likely
thing, said Jack; &lsquo;no, no, I know a trick worth two or
three of that; whether the pea was yours or mine, you will never
have your twenty shillings and one again; and if I have ruined
you, all the better; I&rsquo;d gladly ruin all such villains as
you, who ruin poor men with your dirty tricks, whom you would
knock down and rob on the road if you had but courage: not that I
mean to keep your shillings, with the exception of the two you
cheated from me, which I&rsquo;ll keep.&nbsp; A scramble, boys! a
scramble!&rsquo; said he, flinging up all the silver into the
air, with the exception of the two shillings; and a scramble
there instantly was, between the rustics who had lost their money
and the urchins who came running up; the poor thimble-engro tried
likewise to have his share; but though he flung himself down, in
order to join more effectually in the scramble, he was unable to
obtain a single sixpence; and having in his rage given some of
his fellow scramblers a cuff or two, he was set upon by the boys
and country fellows, and compelled to make an inglorious retreat
with his table, which had been <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>flung down
in the scuffle, and had one of its legs broken.&nbsp; As he
retired, the rabble hooted, and Jack, holding up in derision the
pea with which he had out-man&oelig;uvred him, exclaimed,
&lsquo;I always carry this in my pocket in order to be a match
for vagabonds like you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The tumult over, Jack gone, and the rabble dispersed, I
followed the discomfited adventurer at a distance, who, leaving
the town, went slowly on, carrying his dilapidated piece of
furniture, till coming to an old wall by the roadside, he placed
it on the ground, and sat down, seemingly in deep despondency,
holding his thumb to his mouth.&nbsp; Going nearly up to him, I
stood still, whereupon he looked up, and perceiving I was looking
steadfastly at him, he said, in an angry tone, &lsquo;Arrah! what
for are you staring at me so?&nbsp; By my shoul, I think you are
one of the thaives who are after robbing me.&nbsp; I think I saw
you among them, and if I were only sure of it, I would take the
liberty of trying to give you a big bating.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You have had enough of trying to give people a
beating,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;you had better be taking your
table to some skilful carpenter to get it repaired.&nbsp; He will
do it for sixpence.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Divil a sixpence did you
and your thaives leave me,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;and if you do
not take yourself off, joy, I will be breaking your ugly head
with the foot of it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Arrah, Murtagh!&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;would ye be breaking the head of your old friend
and scholar, to whom you taught the blessed tongue of Oilien nan
Naomha, in exchange for a pack of cards?&rsquo;&nbsp; Murtagh,
for he it was, gazed at me for a moment with a bewildered look;
then, with a gleam of intelligence in his eye, he said,
&lsquo;Shorsha! no, it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;yes, by my faith it
is!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, springing up, and seizing me by the hand,
he said, &lsquo;Yes, by the powers, sure enough it is Shorsha
agra!&nbsp; Arrah, Shorsha! where have you been this many a
day?&nbsp; Sure, you are not one of the spalpeens who are after
robbing me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;but I saw all that happened.&nbsp; Come, you must not take
matters so to heart; cheer up; such things will happen in
connection with the trade you have taken up.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sorrow befall the trade, and the thief who taught it
me,&rsquo; said Murtagh; &lsquo;and yet the trade is not a bad
one, if I only knew more of it, and had some one to help and back
me.&nbsp; Och! the idea of being cheated and bamboozled by that
one-eyed thief in the horseman&rsquo;s dress.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Let bygones be bygones, Murtagh,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;it
is no use grieving for the past; sit down, and let us have a
little pleasant gossip.&nbsp; Arrah, <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>Murtagh!
when I saw you sitting under the wall, with your thumb to your
mouth, it brought to my mind tales which you used to tell me all
about Finn-ma-Coul.&nbsp; You have not forgotten Finn-ma-Coul,
Murtagh, and how he sucked wisdom out of his thumb.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Sorrow a bit have I forgot about him, Shorsha,&rsquo; said
Murtagh, as we sat down together, &lsquo;nor what you yourself
told me about the snake.&nbsp; Arrah, Shorsha! what ye told me
about the snake, bates anything I ever told you about Finn.&nbsp;
Ochone, Shorsha! perhaps you will be telling me about the snake
once more?&nbsp; I think the tale would do me good, and I have
need of comfort, God knows, Ochone!&rsquo;&nbsp; Seeing Murtagh
in such a distressed plight, I forthwith told him over again the
tale of the snake, in precisely the same words as I have related
it in the first part of this history.&nbsp; After which, I said,
&lsquo;Now, Murtagh, tit for tat; ye will be telling me one of
the old stories of Finn-ma-Coul.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Och,
Shorsha!&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t heart enough,&rsquo; said
Murtagh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thank you for your tale, but it makes me
weep; it brings to my mind Dungarvon times of old&mdash;I mean
the times we were at school together.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Cheer
up, man,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and let&rsquo;s have the story,
and let it be about Ma-Coul and the salmon, and his thumb.&rsquo;
<a name="citation291"></a><a href="#footnote291"
class="citation">[291]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Arrah, Shorsha! I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, to oblige you, I&rsquo;ll give it
you.&nbsp; Well you know Ma-Coul was an exposed child, and came
floating over the salt sea in a chest which was cast ashore at
Veintry Bay.&nbsp; In the corner of that bay was a castle, where
dwelt a giant and his wife, very respectable and decent people,
and this giant, taking his morning walk along the bay, came to
the place where the child had been cast ashore in his box.&nbsp;
Well, the giant looked at the child, and being filled with
compassion for his exposed state, took the child up in his box,
and carried him home to his castle, where he and his wife, being
dacent respectable people, as I telled ye before, fostered the
child and took care of him, till he became old enough to go out
to service and gain his livelihood, when they bound him out
apprentice to another giant, who lived in a castle up the
country, at some distance from the bay.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This giant, whose name was Darmod David Odeen, was not
a respectable person at all, but a big old vagabond.&nbsp; He was
twice the size of the other giant, who, though bigger than any
man, was not a big giant; for, as there are great and <!-- page
292--><a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>small men, so there are great and small giants&mdash;I
mean some are small when compared with the others.&nbsp; Well,
Finn served this giant a considerable time, doing all kinds of
hard and unreasonable service for him, and receiving all kinds of
hard words, and many a hard knock and kick to boot&mdash;sorrow
befall the ould vagabond who could thus ill-treat a helpless
foundling.&nbsp; It chanced that one day the giant caught a
salmon, near a salmon-leap upon his estate&mdash;for, though a
big ould blackguard, he was a person of considerable landed
property, and high sheriff for the county Cork.&nbsp; Well, the
giant brings home the salmon by the gills, and delivers it to
Finn, telling him to roast it for the giant&rsquo;s dinner;
&ldquo;but take care, ye young blackguard,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;that in roasting it&mdash;and I expect ye to roast it
well&mdash;you do not let a blister come upon its nice satin
skin, for if ye do, I will cut the head off your
shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thinks Finn,
&ldquo;this is a hard task; however, as I have done many hard
tasks for him, I will try and do this too, though I was never set
to do anything yet half so difficult.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he prepared
his fire, and put his gridiron upon it, and lays the salmon
fairly and softly upon the gridiron, and then he roasts it,
turning it from one side to the other just in the nick of time,
before the soft satin skin could be blistered.&nbsp; However, on
turning it over the eleventh time&mdash;and twelve would have
settled the business&mdash;he found he had delayed a little bit
of time too long in turning it over, and that there was a small,
tiny blister on the soft outer skin.&nbsp; Well, Finn was in a
mighty panic, remembering the threats of the ould giant; however,
he did not lose heart, but clapped his thumb upon the blister in
order to smooth it down.&nbsp; Now the salmon, Shorsha, was
nearly done, and the flesh thoroughly hot, so Finn&rsquo;s thumb
was scalt, and he, clapping it to his mouth, sucked it, in order
to draw out the pain, and in a
moment&mdash;hubbuboo!&mdash;became imbued with all the wisdom of
the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Stop, Murtagh! stop!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; All the witchcraft, Shorsha.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How wonderful!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; Was it not, Shorsha?&nbsp; The salmon,
do you see, was a fairy salmon.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What a strange coincidence.</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; A what, Shorsha!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why that the very same tale should be
told of Finn-ma-Coul, which is related of Sigurd Fafnisbane.</p>
<p><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>&lsquo;What thief was that, Shorsha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thief!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, he took the treasure of
Fafnir.&nbsp; Sigurd was the hero of the North, Murtagh, even as
Finn is the great Hero of Ireland.&nbsp; He, too, according to
one account, was an exposed child, and came floating in a casket
to a wild shore, where he was suckled by a hind, and afterwards
found and fostered by Mimir, a fairy blacksmith; he, too, sucked
wisdom from a burn.&nbsp; According to the Edda, he burnt his
finger whilst feeling of the heart of Fafnir, which he was
roasting, and putting it into his mouth in order to suck out the
pain, became imbued with all the wisdom of the world, the
knowledge of the language of birds, and what not.&nbsp; I have
heard you tell the tale of Finn a dozen times in the blessed days
of old, but its identity with the tale of Sigurd never occurred
to me till now.&nbsp; It is true, when I knew you of old, I had
never read the tale of Sigurd, and have since almost dismissed
matters of Ireland from my mind; but as soon as you told me again
about Finn&rsquo;s burning his finger, the coincidence struck
me.&nbsp; I say, Murtagh, the Irish owe much to the
Danes&mdash;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Devil a bit, Shorsha, do they owe to the thaives,
except many a bloody bating and plundering, which they never paid
them back.&nbsp; Och, Shorsha! you, edicated in ould Ireland, to
say that the Irish owes anything good to the plundering
villains&mdash;the Siol Loughlin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They owe them half their traditions, Murtagh, and
amongst others Finn-ma-Coul and the burnt finger; and if ever I
publish the Loughlin songs, I&rsquo;ll tell the world
so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Shorsha, the world will never believe ye&mdash;to
say nothing of the Irish part of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the world, Murtagh&mdash;to say nothing of the
Irish part of it&mdash;will be a fool, even as I have often
thought it; the grand thing, Murtagh, is to be able to believe
one&rsquo;s self, and respect one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp; How few
whom the world believes believe and respect
themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Och, Shorsha! shall I go on with the tale of
Finn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather you should not, Murtagh; I know about
it already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did you bother me to tell it at first,
Shorsha?&nbsp; Och, it was doing my ownself good, and making me
forget my own sorrowful state, when ye interrupted me with your
thaives of Danes!&nbsp; Och, Shorsha! let me tell you how Finn,
by means of sucking his thumb, and the witchcraft he imbibed from
it, contrived to pull off the arm of the ould <!-- page 294--><a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>wagabone,
Darmod David Odeen, whilst shaking hands with him&mdash;for Finn
could do no feat of strength without sucking his thumb, Shorsha,
as Conan the Bald told the son of Oisin in the song which I used
to sing ye in the Dungarvon times of old;&rsquo; and here Murtagh
repeated certain Irish words to the following effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;O little the foolish words I
heed,<br />
O Oisin&rsquo;s son, from thy lips which come;<br />
No strength were in Finn for valorous deed,<br />
Unless to the gristle he sucked his thumb.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Enough is as good as a feast, Murtagh; I am no longer
in the cue for Finn.&nbsp; I would rather hear your own
history.&nbsp; Now, tell us, man, all that has happened to ye
since Dungarvon times of old?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Och, Shorsha, it would be merely bringing all my
sorrows back upon me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if I know all your sorrows, perhaps I shall be
able to find a help for them.&nbsp; I owe you much, Murtagh; you
taught me Irish, and I will do all I can to help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, then, Shorsha, I&rsquo;ll tell ye my
history.&nbsp; Here goes!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>
<p>MURTAGH&rsquo;S TALE</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Shorsha, about a year and a half after you left
us&mdash;and a sorrowful hour for us it was when ye left us,
losing, as we did, your funny stories of your snake&mdash;and the
battles of your military&mdash;they sent me to Paris and
Salamanca, in order to make a saggart of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray excuse me,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;for interrupting
you, but what kind of place is Salamanca?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Divil a bit did I ever see of it, Shorsha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why did you say ye were sent there?&nbsp; Well,
what kind of place is Paris.&nbsp; Not that I care much about
Paris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorrow a bit did I ever see of either of them, Shorsha,
for no one sent me to either.&nbsp; When we says at home a person
is going to Paris and Salamanca, it manes that he is going abroad
to study to be a saggart, whether he goes to them places or
not.&nbsp; No, I never saw either&mdash;bad luck to them&mdash;I
was shipped away from Cork up the straits to a place called
Leghorn, from which I was sent to --- to a <!-- page 295--><a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>religious
house, where I was to be instructed in saggarting till they had
made me fit to cut a decent figure in Ireland.&nbsp; We had a
long and tedious voyage, Shorsha; not so tedious, however, as it
would have been had I been fool enough to lave your pack of cards
behind me, as the thaif, my brother Dennis, wanted to persuade me
to do, in older that he might play with them himself.&nbsp; With
the cards I managed to have many a nice game with the sailors,
winning from them ha&rsquo;pennies and sixpences until the
captain said that I was ruining his men, and keeping them from
their duty; and, being a heretic and a Dutchman, swore that
unless I gave over he would tie me up to the mast and give me a
round dozen.&nbsp; This threat obliged me to be more on my guard,
though I occasionally contrived to get a game at night, and to
win sixpences and ha&rsquo;pennies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We reached Leghorn at last, and glad I was to leave the
ship and the master, who gave me a kick as I was getting over the
side, bad luck to the dirty heretic for kicking a son of the
church, for I have always been a true son of the church, Shorsha,
and never quarrelled with it unless it interfered with me in my
playing at cards.&nbsp; I left Leghorn with certain muleteers,
with whom I played at cards at the baiting houses, and who
speedily won from me all the ha&rsquo;pennies and sixpences I had
won from the sailors.&nbsp; I got my money&rsquo;s worth,
however, for I learnt from the muleteers all kind of quaint
tricks upon the cards, which I knew nothing of before; so I did
not grudge them what they chated me of, and when we parted we did
so in kindness on both sides.&nbsp; On getting to --- I was
received into the religious house for Irishes.&nbsp; It was the
Irish house, Shorsha, into which I was taken, for I do not wish
ye to suppose that I was in the English religious house which
there is in that city, in which a purty set are educated, and in
which purty doings are going on if all tales be true.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this Irish house I commenced my studies, learning to
sing and to read the Latin prayers of the church.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Faith, Shorsha, many&rsquo;s the sorrowful day I passed in
that house learning the prayers and litanies, being half-starved,
with no earthly diversion at all, at all; until I took the cards
out of my chest and began instructing in card-playing the chum
which I had with me in the cell; then I had plenty of diversion
along with him during the times when I was not engaged in
singing, and chanting, and saying the prayers of the church;
there was, however, some drawback in playing <!-- page 296--><a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>with my
chum, for though he was very clever in learning, divil a sixpence
had he to play with, in which respect he was like myself, the
master who taught him, who had lost all my money to the muleteers
who taught me the tricks upon the cards; by degrees, however, it
began to be noised about the religious house that Murtagh, from
Hibrodary, <a name="citation296"></a><a href="#footnote296"
class="citation">[296]</a> had a pack of cards with which he
played with his chum in the cell; whereupon other scholars of the
religious house came to me, some to be taught and others to play,
so with some I played, and others I taught, but neither to those
who could play, or to those who could not, did I teach the
elegant tricks which I learnt from the muleteers.&nbsp; Well, the
scholars came to me for the sake of the cards, and the porter and
the cook of the religious house, who could both play very well,
came also; at last I became tired of playing for nothing, so I
borrowed a few bits of silver from the cook, and played against
the porter, and by means of my tricks I won money from the
porter, and then I paid the cook the bits of silver which I had
borrowed of him; and played with him, and won a little of his
money, which I let him win back again, as I had lived long enough
in a religious house to know that it is dangerous to take money
from the cook.&nbsp; In a little time, Shorsha, there was
scarcely anything going on in the house but card-playing; the
almoner played with me, and so did the sub-rector, and I won
money from both; not too much, however, lest they should tell the
rector, who had the character of a very austere man, and of being
a bit of a saint; however, the thief of a porter, whose money I
had won, informed the rector of what was going on, and one day
the rector sent for me into his private apartment, and gave me so
long and pious a lecture upon the heinous sin of card-playing,
that I thought I should sink into the ground; after about half an
hour&rsquo;s inveighing against card-playing, he began to soften
his tone, and with a long sigh told me that at one time of his
life he had been a young man himself, and had occasionally used
the cards; he then began to ask me some questions about
card-playing, which questions I afterwards found were to pump
from me what I knew about the science.&nbsp; After a time he
asked me whether I had got my cards with me, and on my telling
him I had, he expressed a wish to see them, whereupon I took the
pack out of my pocket, and showed it to him; he looked at it very
attentively, and at last, giving another deep sigh, he said, that
<!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>though he was nearly weaned from the vanities of the
world, he had still an inclination to see whether he had entirely
lost the little skill which at one time he possessed.&nbsp; When
I heard him speak in this manner, I told him that if his
reverence was inclined for a game of cards, I should be very
happy to play one with him; scarcely had I uttered these words
than he gave a third sigh, and looked so very much like a saint
that I was afraid he was going to excommunicate me.&nbsp; Nothing
of the kind, however, for presently he gets up and locks the
door, then sitting down at the table, he motioned me to do the
same, which I did, and in five minutes there we were playing at
cards, his reverence and myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I soon found that his reverence knew quite as much
about card-playing as I did.&nbsp; Divil a trick was there
connected with cards that his reverence did not seem awake
to.&nbsp; As, however, we were not playing for money, this
circumstance did not give me much uneasiness; so we played game
after game for two hours, when his reverence, having business,
told me I might go, so I took up my cards, made my obedience, and
left him.&nbsp; The next day I had other games with him, and so
on for a very long time, still playing for nothing.&nbsp; At last
his reverence grew tired of playing for nothing, and proposed
that we should play for money.&nbsp; Now I had no desire to play
with his reverence for money, as I knew that doing so would bring
on a quarrel.&nbsp; As long as we were playing for nothing, I
could afford to let his reverence use what tricks he pleased; but
if we played for money, I couldn&rsquo;t do so.&nbsp; If he
played his tricks, I must play mine, and use every advantage to
save my money; and there was one I possessed which his reverence
did not.&nbsp; The cards being my own, I had put some delicate
little marks on the trump cards, just at the edges, so that when
I dealt, by means of a little sleight of hand, I could deal
myself any trump card I pleased.&nbsp; But I wished, as I said
before, to have no dealings for money with his reverence, knowing
that he was master in the house, and that he could lead me a dog
of a life if I offended him, either by winning his money, or not
letting him win mine.&nbsp; So I told him I had no money to play
with, but the ould thief knew better; he knew that I was every
day winning money from the scholars, and the sub-rector, and the
other people of the house, and the ould thief had determined to
let me go on in that way winning money, and then by means of his
tricks, which he thought <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>I dare not
resent, to win from me all my earnings,&mdash;in a word, Shorsha,
to let me fill myself like a sponge, and then squeeze me for his
own advantage.&nbsp; So he made me play with him, and in less
than three days came on the quarrel; his reverence chated me, and
I chated his reverence; the ould thaif knew every trick that I
knew, and one or two more; but in daling out the cards I nicked
his reverence; scarcely a trump did I ever give him, Shorsha, and
won his money purty freely.&nbsp; Och, it was a purty
quarrel!&nbsp; All the delicate names in the &ldquo;Newgate
Calendar,&rdquo; if ye ever heard of such a book; all the
hang-dog names in the Newgate histories, and the lives of Irish
rogues, did we call each other&mdash;his reverence and I!&nbsp;
Suddenly, however, putting out his hand, he seized the cards,
saying, &ldquo;I will examine these cards, ye cheating scoundrel!
for I believe there are dirty marks on them, which ye have made
in order to know the winning cards.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Give me
back my pack,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or m&rsquo;anam on Dioul if I
be not the death of ye!&rdquo;&nbsp; His reverence, however,
clapped the cards into his pocket, and made the best of his way
to the door, I hanging upon him.&nbsp; He was a gross fat man,
but, like most fat men, deadly strong, so he forced his way to
the door, and opening it, flung himself out, with me still
holding on him like a terrier dog on a big fat pig; then he
shouts for help, and in a little time I was secured and thrust
into a lock-up room, where I was left to myself.&nbsp; Here was a
purty alteration.&nbsp; Yesterday I was the idol of the religious
house, thought more on than his reverence, every one paying me
court and wurtship, and wanting to play cards with me, and to
learn my tricks, and fed, moreover, on the tidbits of the table;
and to-day I was in a cell, nobody coming to look at me but the
blackguard porter who had charge of me, my cards taken from me,
and with nothing but bread and water to live upon.&nbsp; Time
passed dreary enough for a month, at the end of which time his
reverence came to me, leaving the porter just outside the door in
older to come to his help should I be violent, and then he read
me a very purty lecture on my conduct, saying I had turned the
religious house topsy-turvy, and corrupted the scholars, and that
I was the cheat of the world, for that on inspecting the pack he
had discovered the dirty marks which I had made upon the trump
cards for to know them by.&nbsp; He said a great deal more to me,
which is not worth relating, and ended by telling me that he
intended to let me out of confinement next day, but that if ever
I misconducted myself <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>any more, he would clap me in again
for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I had a good mind to call him an
ould thaif, but the hope of getting out made me hold my tongue,
and the next day I was let out; and need enough I had to be let
out, for what with being alone, and living on the bread and
water, I was becoming frighted, or, as the doctors call it,
narvous.&nbsp; But when I was out&mdash;oh, what a change I found
in the religious house! no card-playing, for it had been
forbidden to the scholars, and there was now nothing going on but
reading and singing, divil a merry visage to be seen, but plenty
of prim airs and graces; but the case of the scholars, though bad
enough, was not half so bad as mine, for they could spake to each
other, whereas I could not have a word of conversation, for the
ould thaif of a rector had ordered them to send me to
&ldquo;Coventry,&rdquo; telling them that I was a gambling cheat,
with morals bad enough to corrupt a horse regiment; and whereas
they were allowed to divert themselves with going out, I was kept
reading and singing from morn till night.&nbsp; The only soul who
was willing to exchange a word with me was the cook, and
sometimes he and I had a little bit of discourse in a corner, and
we condoled with each other, for he liked the change in the
religious house almost as little as myself; but he told me that,
for all the change below stairs, there was still card playing
going on above, for that the ould thaif of a rector, and the sub
rector, and the almoner played at cards together, and that the
rector won money from the others&mdash;the almoner had told him
so&mdash;and, moreover, that the rector was the thaif of the
world, and had been a gambler in his youth, and had once been
kicked out of a club house at Dublin for cheating at cards, and
after that circumstance had apparently reformed and lived
decently till the time when I came to the religious house with my
pack, but that the sight of that had brought him back to his ould
gambling.&nbsp; He told the cook, moreover, that the rector
frequently went out at night to the houses of the great clergy
and cheated at cards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this melancholy state, with respect to myself,
things continued a long time, when suddenly there was a report
that his Holiness the Pope intended to pay a visit to the
religious house in order to examine into its state of
discipline.&nbsp; When I heard this I was glad, for I determined,
after the Pope had done what he had come to do, to fall upon my
knees before him, and make a regular complaint of the treatment I
had received, to tell him of the cheatings at cards of the
rector, <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>and to beg him to make the ould
thaif give me back my pack again.&nbsp; So the day of the visit
came, and his Holiness made his appearance with his attendants,
and, having looked over the religious house, he went into the
rector&rsquo;s room with the rector, the sub-rector, and the
almoner.&nbsp; I intended to have waited until his Holiness came
out, but finding he stayed a long time, I thought I would
e&rsquo;en go in to him, so I went up to the door without anybody
observing me&mdash;his attendants being walking about the
corridor&mdash;and opening it I slipped in, and there what do you
think I saw?&nbsp; Why, his Holiness the Pope, and his reverence
the rector, and the sub-rector, and the almoner seated at cards;
and the ould thaif of a rector was dealing out the cards which ye
had given me, Shorsha, to his Holiness the Pope, the sub-rector,
the almoner, and himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this part of his history I interrupted Murtagh, saying that
I was afraid he was telling untruths, and that it was highly
improbable that the Pope would leave the Vatican to play cards
with Irish at their religious house, and that I was sure if on
his, Murtagh&rsquo;s authority, I were to tell the world so, the
world would never believe it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then the world, Shorsha, would be a fool, even as you
were just now saying you had frequently believed it to be; the
grand thing, Shorsha, is to be able to believe one&rsquo;s self;
if ye can do that, it matters very little whether the world
believes ye or no.&nbsp; But a purty thing for you and the world
to stickle at the Pope&rsquo;s playing at cards at a religious
house of Irish; och! if I were to tell you and the world what the
Pope has been sometimes at at the religious house of English
thaives, I would excuse you and the world for turning up your
eyes.&nbsp; However, I wish to say nothing against the
Pope.&nbsp; I am a son of the Church, and if the Pope don&rsquo;t
interfere with my cards, divil a bit will I have to say against
him; but I saw the Pope playing, or about to play, with the pack
which had been taken from me, and when I told the Pope, the Pope
did not&mdash;.&nbsp; Ye had better let me go on with my history,
Shorsha; whither you or the world believe it or not, I am sure it
is quite as true as your tale of the snake, or saying that Finn
got his burnt finger from the thaives of Loughlin; and whatever
you may say, I am sure the world will think so too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I apologized to Murtagh for interrupting him, and telling him
that his history, whether true or not, was infinitely diverting,
begged him to continue it.</p>

<p>MURTAGH&rsquo;S STORY CONTINUED&mdash;THE PRIEST, EXORCIST,
AND THIMBLE-ENGRO&mdash;HOW TO CHECK A REBELLION</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was telling ye, Shorsha, when ye interrupted me, that
I found the Pope, the rector, the sub-rector and the almoner
seated at the table, the rector with my pack of cards in his
hand, about to deal out to the Pope and the rest, not forgetting
himself, for whom he intended all the trump-cards, no
doubt.&nbsp; No sooner did they perceive me than they seemed
taken all aback; but the rector, suddenly starting up with the
cards in his hand, asked me what I did there, threatening to have
me well disciplined if I did not go about my business.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am come for my pack,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;ye ould
thaif, and to tell his Holiness how I have been treated by
ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, going down on my knees before his
Holiness, I said, &ldquo;Arrah, now, your Holiness! will ye not
see justice done to a poor boy who has been sadly misused?&nbsp;
The pack of cards which that old ruffian has in his hand are my
cards, which he has taken from me in order to chate with.&nbsp;
Arrah! don&rsquo;t play with him, your Holiness, for he&rsquo;ll
only chate ye&mdash;there are dirty marks upon the cards which
bear the trumps, put there in order to know them by; and the ould
thaif in daling out will give himself all the good cards, and
chate ye of the last farthing in your pocket; so let them be
taken from him, your Holiness, and given back to me; and order
him to lave the room, and then if your Holiness be for an honest
game, don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m the boy to baulk ye.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take the ould ruffian&rsquo;s place, and play with ye
till evening, and all night besides, and divil an advantage will
I take of the dirty marks, though I know them all, having placed
them on the cards myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was going on in this way
when the ould thaif of a rector, flinging down the cards, made at
me as if to kick me out of the room, whereupon I started up and
said, &ldquo;If ye are for kicking, sure two can play at
that,&rdquo; and then I kicked at his reverence, and his
reverence at me, and there was a regular scrimmage between us,
which frightened the Pope, who, getting up, said some words which
I did not understand, but which the cook afterwards told me were,
&ldquo;English extravagance, and this is the second
edition&rdquo;; for it seems that a little time before his
Holiness had been frightened in St. <!-- page 302--><a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>Peter&rsquo;s Church by the servant of an English
family, which those thaives of the English religious house had
been endeavouring to bring over to the Catholic faith, and who
didn&rsquo;t approve of their being converted.&nbsp; Och! his
Holiness did us all sore injustice to call us English, and to
confound our house with the other; for however dirty our house
might be, our house was a clane house compared with the English
house, and we honest people compared with those English
thaives.&nbsp; Well, his Holiness was frighted, and the almoner
ran out, and brought in his Holiness&rsquo;s attendants, and they
laid hold of me, but I struggled hard, and said, &ldquo;I will
not go without my pack; arrah, your Holiness! make them give me
back my pack, which Shorsha gave me in Dungarvon times of
old,&rdquo; but my struggles were of no use.&nbsp; I was pulled
away and put in the ould dungeon, and his Holiness went away sore
frighted, crossing himself much, and never returned again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the old dungeon I was fastened to the wall by a
chain, and there I was disciplined once every other day for the
first three weeks, and then I was left to myself, and my chain,
and hunger; and there I sat in the dungeon, sometimes screeching,
sometimes holloing, for I soon became frighted, having nothing in
the cell to divert me.&nbsp; At last the cook found his way to me
by stealth, and comforted me a little, bringing me tidbits out of
the kitchen; and he visited me again and again&mdash;not often,
however, for he dare only come when he could steal away the key
from the custody of the thief of a porter.&nbsp; I was three
years in the dungeon, and should have gone mad but for the cook,
and his words of comfort, and his tidbits, and nice books which
he brought me out of the library, which were the &ldquo;Calendars
of Newgate,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lives of Irish Rogues and
Raparees,&rdquo; the only English Books in the library.&nbsp;
However, at the end of three years, the ould thaif of a rector,
wishing to look at them books, missed them from the library, and
made a perquisition about them, and the thaif of a porter said
that he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I had them, saying that he had
once seen me reading; and then the rector came with others to my
cell, and took my books from me, from under my straw, and asked
me how I came by them; and on my refusal to tell, they
disciplined me again till the blood ran down my back; and making
some perquisition, they at last accused the cook of having
carried the books to me, and the cook not denying, he was given
warning to leave next day, but he <!-- page 303--><a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>left that
night, and took me away with him; for he stole the key, and came
to me and cut my chain through, and then he and I escaped from
the religious house through a window&mdash;the cook with a
bundle, containing what things he had.&nbsp; No sooner had we got
out than the honest cook gave me a little bit of money and a
loaf, and told me to follow a way which he pointed out, which he
said would lead to the sea; and then, having embraced me after
the Italian way, he left me, and I never saw him again.&nbsp; So
I followed the way which the cook pointed out, and in two days
reached a seaport called Chiviter Vik, <a
name="citation303a"></a><a href="#footnote303a"
class="citation">[303a]</a> terribly foot-foundered, and there I
met a sailor who spoke Irish, and who belonged to a vessel just
ready to sail for France; and the sailor took me on board his
vessel, and said I was his brother, and the captain gave me a
passage to a place in France called Marseilles; and when I got
there, the captain and sailor got a little money for me and a
passport, and I travelled across the country towards a place they
directed me to called Bayonne, from which, they said I might,
perhaps, get to Ireland.&nbsp; Coming, however, to a place called
Pau, all my money being gone, I enlisted into a regiment called
the Army of the Faith, which was going into Spain, for the King
of Spain had been dethroned and imprisoned by his own subjects,
as perhaps you may have heard; and the King of France, who was
his cousin, was sending an army to help him, under the command of
his own son, whom the English called Prince Hilt, <a
name="citation303b"></a><a href="#footnote303b"
class="citation">[303b]</a> because when he was told that he was
appointed to the command, he clapped his hand on the hilt of his
sword.&nbsp; So I enlisted into the regiment of the Faith, which
was made up of Spaniards, many of them priests who had run out of
Spain, and broken Germans, and foot-foundered Irish, like
myself.&nbsp; It was said to be a blackguard regiment, that same
regiment of the Faith; but, &rsquo;faith, I saw nothing
blackguardly going on in it, for ye would hardly reckon
card-playing and dominoes, and pitch and toss blackguardly, and I
saw nothing else going on in it.&nbsp; There was one thing in it
which I disliked&mdash;the priests drawing their Spanish knives
occasionally, when they lost their money.&nbsp; After we had been
some time at Pau, the Army of the Faith was sent across the
mountains into Spain, as the vanguard of the French; and no
sooner did the Spaniards see the Faith than they made a dash at
it, and the Faith ran away, myself along with it, and got behind
the French army, which told <!-- page 304--><a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>it to keep
there, and the Faith did so, and followed the French army, which
soon scattered the Spaniards, and in the end placed the king on
his throne again.&nbsp; When the war was over the Faith was
disbanded; some of the foreigners, however, amongst whom I was
one, were put into a Guard regiment, and there I continued for
more than a year.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One day, being at a place called the Escurial, I took
stock, as the tradesmen say, and found I possessed the sum of
eighty dollars won by playing at cards; for though I could not
play so well with the foreign cards as with the pack ye gave me,
Shorsha, I had yet contrived to win money from the priests and
soldiers of the Faith.&nbsp; Finding myself possessed of such a
capital, I determined to leave the service and to make the best
of my way to Ireland; so I deserted, but coming in an evil hour
to a place they calls Torre Lodones, I found the priest playing
at cards with his parishioners.&nbsp; The sight of the cards made
me stop, and then, fool like, notwithstanding the treasure I had
about me, I must wish to play, so not being able to speak their
language I made signs to them to let me play, and the priest and
his thaives consented willingly; so I sat down to cards with the
priest and two of his parishioners, and in a little time had won
plenty of their money, but I had better never have done any such
a thing, for suddenly the priest and all his parishioners set
upon me and bate me, and took from me all I had, and cast me out
of the village more dead than alive.&nbsp; Och! it&rsquo;s a bad
village that, and if I had known what it was I would have avoided
it, or run straight through it, though I saw all the card-playing
in the world going on in it.&nbsp; There is a proverb about it,
as I was afterwards told, old as the time of the Moors, which
holds good to the present day&mdash;it is, that in Torre Lodones
there are twenty-four housekeepers, and twenty-five thieves,
maning that all the people are thaives, and the clergyman to
boot, who is not reckoned a housekeeper; and troth I found the
clergyman the greatest thaif of the lot.&nbsp; After being cast
out of that village I travelled for nearly a month, subsisting by
begging tolerably well, for though most of the Spaniards are
thaives, they are rather charitable; but though charitable
thaives they do not like their own being taken from them without
leave being asked, as I found to my cost; for on my entering a
garden near Seville, without leave, to take an orange, the
labourer came running up and struck me to the <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>ground with
a hatchet, giving me a big wound in the arm.&nbsp; I fainted with
loss of blood, and on my reviving I found myself in a hospital at
Seville, to which the labourer and the people of the village had
taken me.&nbsp; I should have died of starvation in that hospital
had not some English people heard of me and come to see me; they
tended me with food till I was cured, and then paid my passage on
board a ship to London, to which place the ship carried me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now I was in London with five shillings in my
pocket&mdash;all I had in the world&mdash;and that did not last
for long; and when it was gone I begged in the streets, but I did
not get much by that, except a month&rsquo;s hard labour in the
correction-house; and when I came out I knew not what to do, but
thought I would take a walk in the country, for it was
spring-time, and the weather was fine, so I took a walk about
seven miles from London, and came to a place where a great fair
was being held; and there I begged, but got nothing but a
halfpenny, and was thinking of going farther, when I saw a man
with a table, like that of mine, playing with thimbles, as you
saw me.&nbsp; I looked at the play, and saw him win money and run
away, and hunted by constables more than once.&nbsp; I kept
following the man, and at last entered into conversation with
him, and learning from him that he was in want of a companion to
help him, I offered to help him if he would pay me; he looked at
me from top to toe, and did not wish at first to have anything to
do with me, as he said my appearance was against me.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Faith, Shorsha, he had better have looked at home, for his
appearance was not much in his favour: he looked very much like a
Jew, Shorsha.&nbsp; However, he at last agreed to take me to be
his companion, or bonnet, as he called it; and I was to keep a
look out and let him know when constables were coming, and to
spake a good word for him occasionally, whilst he was chating
folks with his thimbles and his pea.&nbsp; So I became his
bonnet, and assisted him in the fair, and in many other fairs
beside; but I did not like my occupation much, or, rather, my
master, who, though not a big man, was a big thaif, and an unkind
one, for do all I could I could never give him pleasure; and he
was continually calling me fool and bogtrotter, and twitting me
because I could not learn his thaives&rsquo; Latin, and discourse
with him in it, and comparing me with another acquaintance, or
bit of a pal of his, whom he said he had parted with in the fair,
and of whom he was fond of saying all <!-- page 306--><a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>kinds of
wonderful things, amongst others, that he knew the grammar of all
tongues.&nbsp; At last, wearied with being twitted by him with
not being able to learn his thaives&rsquo; Greek, I proposed that
I should teach him Irish, that we should spake it together when
we had anything to say in sacret.&nbsp; To that he consented
willingly; but, och! a purty hand he made with Irish,
&rsquo;faith, not much better than did I with his thaives&rsquo;
Hebrew.&nbsp; Then my turn came, and I twitted him nicely with
dulness, and compared him with a pal that I had in ould Ireland,
in Dungarvon times of yore, to whom I teached Irish, telling him
that he was the broth of a boy, and not only knew the grammar of
all human tongues, but the dialects of the snakes besides; in
fact, I tould him all about your own sweet self, Shorsha, and
many a dispute and quarrel had we together about our pals, which
was the cleverest fellow, his or mine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, after having been wid him about two months, I
quitted him without noise, taking away one of his tables, and
some peas and thimbles: and that I did with a safe conscience,
for he paid me nothing, and was not over free with the meat and
the drink, though I must say of him that he was a clever fellow,
and perfect master of his trade, by which he made a power of
money, and bating his not being able to learn Irish, and a
certain Jewish lisp which he had, a great master of his tongue,
of which he was very proud, so much so that he once told me that
when he had saved a certain sum of money he meant to leave off
the thimbling business, and enter Parliament, into which he said
he could get at any time, through the interest of a friend of
his, a Tory Peer, my Lord Whitefeather, with whom he said he had
occasionally done business.&nbsp; With the table and other things
which I had taken I commenced trade on my own account, having
contrived to learn a few of his tricks.&nbsp; My only capital was
the change for half-a-guinea, which he had once let fall, and
which I picked up, which was all I could ever get from him, for
it was impossible to stale any money from him, he was so awake,
being up to all the tricks of thaives, having followed the diving
trade, as he called it, for a considerable time.&nbsp; My wish
was to make enough by my table to enable me to return with credit
to ould Ireland, where I had no doubt of being able to get myself
ordained as priest; and, in troth, notwithstanding I was a
beginner, and without any companion to help me, I did tolerably
well, getting my meat and drink, and increasing my small capital,
<!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>till I came to this unlucky place of Horncastle, where
I was utterly ruined by the thaif in the rider&rsquo;s
dress.&nbsp; And now, Shorsha, I am after telling you my history;
perhaps you will now be telling me something about
yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I told Murtagh all about myself that I deemed necessary to
relate, and then asked him what he intended to do; he repeated
that he was utterly ruined, and that he had no prospect before
him but starving, or making away with himself.&nbsp; I inquired,
&lsquo;How much would take him to Ireland, and establish him
there with credit?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Five pounds,&rsquo; he
answered, adding, &lsquo;but who in the world would be fool
enough to lend me five pounds, unless it be yourself, Shorsha,
who, may be, have not got it; for when you told me about
yourself, you made no boast of the state of your
affairs.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not very rich,&rsquo; I
replied, &lsquo;but I think I can accommodate you with what you
want.&nbsp; I consider myself under great obligations to you,
Murtagh; it was you who instructed me in the language of Oilein
nan Naomha, which has been the foundation of all my acquisitions
in philology; without you I should not be what I
am&mdash;Lavengro! which signifies a philologist.&nbsp; Here is
the money, Murtagh,&rsquo; said I, putting my hand into my pocket
and taking out five pounds; &lsquo;much good may it do
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; He took the money, stared at it, and then at
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;And you mane to give me this,
Shorsha?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not mine to give,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;it is yours.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And you give it me for
the gratitude you bear me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said
I; &lsquo;and for Dungarvon times of old.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, Shorsha,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are a broth of a
boy, and I&rsquo;ll take your benefaction&mdash;five
pounds!&nbsp; Och, Jasus!&rsquo;&nbsp; He then put the money in
his pocket, and springing up, waved his hat three times, uttering
some old Irish cry; then, sitting down, he took my hand and said,
&lsquo;Sure, Shorsha, I&rsquo;ll be going thither; and when I get
there, it is turning over another leaf I will be; I have learnt a
thing or two abroad; I will become a priest; that&rsquo;s the
trade, Shorsha! and I will cry out for repale; that&rsquo;s the
cry, Shorsha! and I&rsquo;ll be a fool no longer.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And what will you do with your table?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll be taking it with me, Shorsha;
and when I gets to Ireland I&rsquo;ll get it mended, and I will
keep it in the house which I shall have; and when I looks upon
it, I will be thinking of all I have undergone.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;You had better leave it behind you,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;if you take it with you you will, perhaps, take up the
thimble trade again before you get to Ireland, and lose the money
I am after giving you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No <!-- page 308--><a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>fear of
that, Shorsha; never will I play on that table again, Shorsha,
till I get it mended, which shall not be till I am a priest, and
have a house in which to place it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Murtagh and I then went into the town, where we had some
refreshment together, and then parted on our several ways.&nbsp;
I heard nothing of him for nearly a quarter of a century, when a
person who knew him well, coming from Ireland, and staying at my
humble house, told me a great deal about him.&nbsp; He reached
Ireland in safety, soon reconciled himself with his Church and
was ordained a priest; in the priestly office he acquitted
himself in a way very satisfactory, upon the whole, to his
superiors, having, as he frequently said, learned wisdom
abroad.&nbsp; The Popish Church never fails to turn to account
any particular gift which its servants may possess; and
discovering soon that Murtagh was endowed with considerable
manual dexterity&mdash;proof of which he frequently gave at
cards, and at a singular game which he occasionally played with
thimbles&mdash;it selected him as a very fit person to play the
part of exorcist; and accordingly he travelled through a great
part of Ireland, casting out devils from people possessed, which
he afterwards exhibited, sometimes in the shape of rabbits, and
occasionally birds and fish.&nbsp; There is a holy island in a
lake in Ireland, to which the people resort at a particular
season of the year.&nbsp; Here Murtagh frequently attended, and
it was here that he performed a cure which will cause his name
long to be remembered in Ireland, delivering a possessed woman of
two demons, which he brandished aloft in his hands, in the shape
of two large eels, and subsequently hurled into the lake, amidst
the shouts of an enthusiastic multitude.&nbsp; Besides playing
the part of an exorcist, he acted that of a politician with
considerable success; he attached himself to the party of the
sire of agitation&mdash;&lsquo;the man of paunch,&rsquo; and
preached and halloed for repeal with the loudest and best, as
long as repeal was the cry; as soon, however, as the Whigs
attained the helm of Government, and the greater part of the
loaves and fishes&mdash;more politely termed the patronage of
Ireland&mdash;was placed in the disposition of the priesthood,
the tone of Murtagh, like that of the rest of his brother
saggarts, was considerably softened; he even went so far as to
declare that politics were not altogether consistent with
sacerdotal duty; and resuming his exorcisms, which he had for
some time abandoned, he went to the Isle of Holiness, and
delivered a possessed woman of <!-- page 309--><a
name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 309</span>six demons
in the shape of white mice.&nbsp; He, however, again resumed the
political mantle in the year 1848, during the short period of the
rebellion of the so-called Young Irelanders.&nbsp; The priests,
though they apparently sided with this party, did not approve of
it, as it was chiefly formed of ardent young men, fond of what
they termed liberty, and by no means admirers of priestly
domination, being mostly Protestants.&nbsp; Just before the
outbreak of this rebellion, it was determined between the priests
and the ---, that this party should be rendered comparatively
innocuous by being deprived of the sinews of war&mdash;in other
words, certain sums of money which they had raised for their
enterprise.&nbsp; Murtagh was deemed the best qualified person in
Ireland to be entrusted with the delicate office of getting their
money from them.&nbsp; Having received his instructions, he
invited the leaders to his parsonage amongst the mountains, under
pretence of deliberating with them about what was to be
done.&nbsp; They arrived there just before nightfall, dressed in
red, yellow, and green, the colours so dear to enthusiastic
Irishmen; Murtagh received them with great apparent cordiality,
and entered into a long discourse with them, promising them the
assistance of himself and order, and received from them a
profusion of thanks.&nbsp; After a time Murtagh, observing, in a
jocular tone, that consulting was dull work, proposed a game of
cards, and the leaders, though somewhat surprised, he went to a
closet, and taking out a pack of cards, laid it upon the table;
it was a strange dirty pack, and exhibited every mark of having
seen some very long service.&nbsp; On one of his guests making
some remarks on the &lsquo;ancientness&rsquo; of its appearance,
Murtagh observed that there was a very wonderful history attached
to that pack; it had been presented to him, he said, by a young
gentleman, a disciple of his, to whom, in Dungarvon times of
yore, he had taught the Irish language, and of whom he related
some very extraordinary things; he added that he, Murtagh, had
taken it to ---, where it had once the happiness of being in the
hands of the Holy Father; by a great misfortune, he did not say
what, he had lost possession of it, and had returned without it,
but had some time since recovered it; a nephew of his, who was
being educated at --- for a priest, having found it in a nook of
the college, and sent it to him.</p>
<p>Murtagh and the leaders then played various games with this
pack, more especially one called by the initiated &lsquo;blind
<!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>hookey,&rsquo; the result being that at the end of
about two hours the leaders found they had lost one-half of their
funds; they now looked serious, and talked of leaving the house,
but Murtagh begging them to stay supper, they consented.&nbsp;
After supper, at which the guests drank rather freely, Murtagh
said that, as he had not the least wish to win their money, he
intended to give them their revenge; he would not play at cards
with them, he added, but at a funny game of thimbles, at which
they would be sure of winning back their own; then, going out, he
brought in a table, tall and narrow, on which placing certain
thimbles and a pea, he proposed that they should stake whatever
they pleased on the almost certainty of finding the pea under the
thimbles.&nbsp; The leaders, after some hesitation, consented,
and were at first eminently successful winning back the greater
part of what they had lost; after some time, however, Fortune,
or, rather, Murtagh, turned against them, and then, instead of
leaving off, they doubled and trebled their stakes, and continued
doing so until they had lost nearly the whole of their
funds.&nbsp; Quite furious, they now swore that Murtagh had
cheated them, and insisted on having their property restored to
them.&nbsp; Murtagh, without a word of reply, went to the door,
and shouting into the passage something in Irish, the room was
instantly filled with bogtrotters, each at least six feet high,
with a stout shillealah in his hand.&nbsp; Murtagh, then turning
to his guests, asked them what they meant by insulting an
anointed priest; telling them that it was not for the likes of
them to avenge the wrongs of Ireland.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been
clane mistaken in the whole of ye,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I
supposed ye Irish, but have found to my sorrow that ye are
nothing of the kind; purty fellows to pretend to be Irish, when
there is not a word of Irish on the tongue of any of ye, divil a
ha&rsquo;porth; the illigant young gentleman to whom I taught
Irish in Dungarvon times of old, though not born in Ireland, has
more Irish in him than any ten of ye.&nbsp; He is the boy to
avenge the wrongs of Ireland, if ever foreigner is to do
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, saying something to the bogtrotters, they
instantly cleared the room of the young Irelanders, who retired
sadly disconcerted; nevertheless, being very silly young fellows,
they hoisted the standard of rebellion; few, however, joining
them, partly because they had no money, and partly because the
priests abused them with might and main, their rebellion ended in
a lamentable manner, themselves being seized and tried, and
though convicted, not deemed of sufficient importance to be <!--
page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>sent to the scaffold, where they might have had the
satisfaction of saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Dulce et decorum est pro patri&acirc;
mori.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My visitor, after saying that of the money won Murtagh
retained a considerable portion, that a part went to the
hierarchy for what were called church purposes, and that the ---
took the remainder, which it employed in establishing a
newspaper, in which the private characters of the worthiest and
most loyal Protestants in Ireland were traduced and vilified,
concluded his account by observing that it was the common belief
that Murtagh, having by his services, ecclesiastical and
political, acquired the confidence of the priesthood and favour
of the Government, would, on the first vacancy, be appointed to
the high office of Popish Primate of Ireland.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>
<p>DEPARTURE FROM HORNCASTLE&mdash;RECRUITING
SERGEANT&mdash;KAULOES AND LOLLOES.</p>
<p>Leaving Horncastle I bent my steps in the direction of the
east. <a name="citation311a"></a><a href="#footnote311a"
class="citation">[311a]</a>&nbsp; I walked at a brisk rate, and
late in the evening reached a large town, <a
name="citation311b"></a><a href="#footnote311b"
class="citation">[311b]</a> situate at the entrance of an
extensive firth, or arm of the sea, which prevented my further
progress eastward.&nbsp; Sleeping that night in the suburbs of
the town, I departed early next morning in the direction of the
south.&nbsp; A walk of about twenty miles brought me to another
large town, <a name="citation311c"></a><a href="#footnote311c"
class="citation">[311c]</a> situated on a river, where I again
turned towards the east.&nbsp; At the end of the town I was
accosted by a fiery-faced individual, somewhat under the middle
size, dressed as a recruiting sergeant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; said the recruiting sergeant,
&lsquo;you are just the kind of person to serve the Honourable
East India Company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had rather the Honourable Company should serve
me,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, young man.&nbsp; Well, the Honourable East
India Company shall serve you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
reasonable.&nbsp; Here, take this shilling; &rsquo;t is
service-money.&nbsp; The Honourable Company engages to serve you,
and you the Honourable <!-- page 312--><a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>Company;
both parties shall be thus served; that&rsquo;s just and
reasonable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what must I do for the Company?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only go to India; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what should I do in India?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fight, my brave boy! fight, my youthful
hero!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of country is India?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The finest country in the world!&nbsp; Rivers bigger
than the Ouse!&nbsp; Hills higher than anything near
Spalding!&nbsp; Trees&mdash;you never saw such trees!&nbsp;
Fruits&mdash;you never saw such fruits!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the people&mdash;what kind of folk are
they?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pah!&nbsp; Kauloes&mdash;blacks&mdash;a set of rascals
not worth regarding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kauloes!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;blacks!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the recruiting sergeant; &lsquo;and
they call us lolloes, which in their beastly gibberish means
reds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lolloes!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;reds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the recruiting sergeant,
&lsquo;kauloes and lolloes; and all the lolloes have to do is to
kick and cut down the kauloes, and take from them their rupees,
which mean silver money.&nbsp; Why do you stare so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;this is the very language of
Mr. Petulengro.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Pet&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and Tawno Chikno.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tawno Chik&mdash;?&nbsp; I say, young fellow, I
don&rsquo;t like your way of speaking; no, nor your way of
looking.&nbsp; You are mad, sir; you are mad; and what&rsquo;s
this?&nbsp; Why your hair is grey!&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t do for
the Honourable Company&mdash;they like red.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad
I didn&rsquo;t give you the shilling.&nbsp; Good day to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; said I, as I proceeded
rapidly along a broad causeway, in the direction of the east,
&lsquo;if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno came originally from
India.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go there.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;A WORD FOR LAVENGRO</h3>
<p>Lavengro is the history up to a certain period of one of
rather a peculiar mind and system of nerves, with an exterior shy
and cold, under which lurk much curiosity, especially with regard
to what is wild and extraordinary, a considerable quantity of
energy and industry, and an unconquerable love of
independence.&nbsp; It narrates his earliest dreams and feelings,
dwells with minuteness on the ways, words, and characters of his
father, mother, and brother; lingers on the occasional
resting-places of his wandering half military childhood;
describes the gradual hardening of his bodily frame by robust
exercises, his successive struggles, after his family and himself
have settled down in a small local capital, to obtain knowledge
of every kind, but more particularly philological lore; his
visits to the tent of the Romany chal and the parlour of the
Anglo-German philosopher; the effect produced upon his character
by his flinging himself into contact with people all widely
differing from each other, but all extraordinary; his reluctance
to settle down to the ordinary pursuits of life; his struggles
after moral truth; his glimpses of God and the obscuration of the
Divine Being to his mind&rsquo;s eye; and his being cast upon the
<!-- page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
314</span>world of London, by the death of his father, at the age
of nineteen. <a name="citation314a"></a><a href="#footnote314a"
class="citation">[314a]</a>&nbsp; In the world within a world,
the world of London, it shows him playing his part for some time
as he best can in the capacity of a writer for reviews and
magazines, and describes what he saw and underwent whilst
labouring in that capacity; it represents him, however, as never
forgetting that he is the son of a brave but poor gentleman, and
that if he is a hack author, he is likewise a scholar.&nbsp; It
shows him doing no dishonourable jobs, and proves that if he
occasionally associates with low characters, he does so chiefly
to gratify the curiosity of a scholar.&nbsp; In his conversations
with the apple-woman of London Bridge the scholar is ever
apparent, so, again, in his acquaintance with the man of the
table, for the book is no raker up of the uncleanness of London;
and if it gives what at first sight appears refuse, it invariably
shows that a pearl of some kind, generally a philological one, is
contained amongst it.&nbsp; It shows its hero always accompanied
by his love of independence, scorning in the greatest poverty to
receive favours from anybody, and describes him finally rescuing
himself from peculiarly miserable circumstances by writing a
book, an original book, within a week, even as Johnson is said to
have written his &lsquo;Rasselas,&rsquo; and Beckford his
&lsquo;Vathek,&rsquo; and tells how, leaving London, he betakes
himself to the roads and fields.</p>
<p>In the country it shows him leading a life of roving
adventure, becoming tinker, gypsy, postillion, ostler;
associating with various kinds of people, chiefly of the lower
classes, whose ways and habits are described; but, though leading
this erratic life, we gather from the book that his habits are
neither vulgar nor vicious, that he still follows to a certain
extent his favourite pursuits&mdash;hunting after strange
characters, or analyzing strange words and names.&nbsp; At the
conclusion of the fifth volume, which terminates the first part
of the history, it hints that he is about to quit his native land
on a grand philological expedition.</p>
<p>Those who read this book with attention&mdash;and the author
begs to observe that it would be of little utility to read it
hurriedly&mdash;may derive much information with respect to
matters of philology and literature; it will be found treating of
most of the principal languages from Ireland to China, and of the
literature which they contain; and it is particularly minute with
regard to the ways, manners, and speech of the English section of
the most extraordinary and mysterious clan or tribe of people to
be found in the whole world&mdash;the children of Roma. <a
name="citation314b"></a><a href="#footnote314b"
class="citation">[314b]</a>&nbsp; But it contains matters of much
more importance than anything in connection with philology, and
the literature and manners of nations.&nbsp; Perhaps no work was
ever offered to the public in <!-- page 315--><a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>which the
kindness and providence of God have been set forth by more
striking examples, or the machinations of priestcraft been more
truly and lucidly exposed, or the dangers which result to a
nation when it abandons itself to effeminacy, and a rage for what
is novel and fashionable, than the present.</p>
<p>With respect to the kindness and providence of God, are they
not exemplified in the case of the old apple-woman and her
son?&nbsp; These are beings in many points bad, but with warm
affections, who, after an agonizing separation, are restored to
each other, but not until the hearts of both are changed and
purified by the influence of affliction.&nbsp; Are they not
exemplified in the case of the rich gentleman, who touches
objects in order to avert the evil chance?&nbsp; This being has
great gifts and many amiable qualities; but does not everybody
see that his besetting sin is selfishness?&nbsp; He fixes his
mind on certain objects, and takes inordinate interest in them
because they are his own, and those very objects, through the
providence of God, which is kindness in disguise, becomes snakes
and scorpions to whip him.&nbsp; Tired of various pursuits, he at
last becomes an author, and publishes a book, which is very much
admired, and which he loves with his usual inordinate
affection.&nbsp; The book, consequently, becomes a viper to him,
and at last he flings it aside and begins another.&nbsp; The
book, however, is not flung aside by the world, who are benefited
by it, deriving pleasure and knowledge from it; so the man who
merely wrote to gratify self has already done good to others, and
got himself an honourable name.&nbsp; But God will not allow that
man to put that book under his head and use it as a pillow; the
book has become a viper to him, he has banished it, and is about
another, which he finishes and gives to the world.&nbsp; It is a
better book than the first, and everyone is delighted with it,
but it proves to the writer a scorpion because he loves it with
inordinate affection; but it was good for the world that he
produced this book, which stung him as a scorpion.&nbsp; Yes, and
good for himself, for the labour of writing it amused him, and
perhaps prevented him from dying of apoplexy.&nbsp; But the book
is banished, and another is begun, and herein, again, is the
providence of God manifested; the man has the power of producing
still, and God determines that he shall give to the world what
remains in his brain, which he would not do had he been satisfied
with the second work; he would have gone to sleep upon that as he
would upon the first, for the man is selfish and lazy.&nbsp; In
his account of what he suffered during the composition of this
work, his besetting sin of selfishness is manifest enough; the
work on which he is engaged occupies his every thought&mdash;it
is his idol, his deity, it shall be all his own, he won&rsquo;t
borrow a thought from anyone else, and he is so afraid lest, when
he publishes it, that it should be thought that he had borrowed
from anyone, that he is continually touching objects, <!-- page
316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>his nervous system, owing to his extreme selfishness,
having become partly deranged.&nbsp; He is left touching, in
order to banish the evil chance from his book, his deity.&nbsp;
No more of his history is given; but does the reader think that
God will permit that man to go to sleep on his third book,
however extraordinary it may be?&nbsp; Assuredly not.&nbsp; God
will not permit that man to rest till He has cured him to a
certain extent of his selfishness, which has, however, hitherto
been very useful to the world.</p>
<p>Then, again in the tale of Peter Williams, is not the hand of
Providence to be seen?&nbsp; This person commits a sin in his
childhood&mdash;utters words of blasphemy&mdash;the remembrance
of which in after life, preying upon his imagination, unfits him
for quiet pursuits, to which he seems to have been naturally
inclined; but for the remembrance of that sin, he would have been
Peter Williams the quiet, respectable Welsh farmer, somewhat fond
of reading the ancient literature of his country in winter
evenings after his work was done.&nbsp; God, however, was aware
that there was something in Peter Williams to entitle him to
assume a higher calling; He therefore permits this sin, which,
though a childish affair, was yet a sin, and committed
deliberately, to prey upon his mind till he becomes at last an
instrument in the hand of God, a humble Paul, the great preacher,
Peter Williams, who, though he considers himself a reprobate and
a castaway, instead of having recourse to drinking in mad
desperation&mdash;at many do who consider themselves
reprobates&mdash;goes about Wales and England preaching the Word
of God, dilating on His power and majesty, and visiting the sick
and afflicted, until God sees fit to restore to him his peace of
mind, which He does not do, however, until that mind is in a
proper condition to receive peace&mdash;till it has been purified
by the pain of the one idea which has so long been permitted to
riot in his brain, which pain, however, an angel, in the shape of
a gentle faithful wife, had occasionally alleviated; for God is
merciful even in the blows which He bestoweth, and will not
permit anyone to be tempted beyond the measure which he can
support.&nbsp; And here it will be as well for the reader to
ponder upon the means by which the Welsh preacher is relieved
from his mental misery; he is not relieved by a text from the
Bible, by the words of consolation and wisdom addressed to him by
his angel-minded wife, nor by the preaching of one yet more
eloquent than himself, but by a quotation made by Lavengro from
the life of Mary Flanders, cut-purse and prostitute, which life
Lavengro had been in the habit of reading at the stall of his old
friend the apple-woman, on London Bridge, who had herself been
very much addicted to the perusal of it, though without any
profit whatever.&nbsp; Should the reader be dissatisfied with the
manner in which Peter Williams is made to find relief, the author
would wish to answer, that the Almighty frequently accomplishes
His <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>purposes by means which appear very
singular to the eyes of men, and at the same time to observe that
the manner in which that relief is obtained is calculated to read
a lesson to the proud, fanciful, and squeamish, who are ever in a
fidget lest they should be thought to mix in low society, or to
bestow a moment&rsquo;s attention on publications which are not
what is called of a perfectly unobjectionable character.&nbsp;
Had not Lavengro formed the acquaintance of the old apple-woman
on London Bridge, he would not have had an opportunity of reading
the life of Mary Flanders, and, consequently, of storing in a
memory which never forgets anything, a passage which contained a
balm for the agonized mind of Peter Williams.&nbsp; The best
medicines are not always found in the finest shops.&nbsp;
Suppose, for example, if, instead of going to London Bridge to
read, he had gone to Albemarle Street, and had received from the
proprietors of the literary establishment in that very
fashionable street permission to read the publications on the
tables of the saloons there, does the reader think he would have
met any balm in those publications for the case of Peter
Williams?&nbsp; Does the reader suppose that he would have found
Mary Flanders there?&nbsp; He would certainly have found that
highly objectionable publication, &lsquo;Rasselas,&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Spectator,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lives of Royal and Illustrious
Personages,&rsquo; but, of a surety, no Mary Flanders.&nbsp; So,
when Lavengro met with Peter Williams, he would have been
unprovided with a balm to cure his ulcerated mind, and have
parted from him in a way not quite so satisfactory as the manner
in which he took his leave of him; for it is certain that he
might have read &lsquo;Rasselas,&rsquo; and all the other
unexceptionable works to be found in the library of Albemarle
Street, over and over again, before he would have found any cure
in them for the case of Peter Williams.&nbsp; Therefore the
author requests the reader to drop any squeamish nonsense he may
wish to utter about Mary Flanders and the manner in which Peter
Williams was cured.</p>
<p>And now with respect to the old man who knew Chinese, but
could not tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; This individual was
a man whose natural powers would have been utterly buried and
lost beneath a mountain of sloth and laziness had not God
determined otherwise.&nbsp; He had in his early years chalked out
for himself a plan of life in which he had his own ease and
self-indulgence solely in view; he had no particular bad passions
to gratify, he only wished to lead an easy quiet life, just as if
the business of this mighty world could be carried on by innocent
people fond of ease and quiet, or that Providence would permit
innocent quiet drones to occupy any portion of the earth and to
cumber it.&nbsp; God had, at any rate, decreed that this man
should not cumber it as a drone.&nbsp; He brings a certain
affliction upon him, the agony of which produces that terrible
whirling of the brain which, unless it is stopped in time,
produces madness; he <!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>suffers indescribable misery for a
period, until one morning his attention is arrested and his
curiosity is aroused by certain Chinese letters on a teapot; his
curiosity increases more and more, and, of course, in proportion
as his curiosity is increased with respect to the Chinese marks,
the misery in his brain produced by his mental affliction
decreases.&nbsp; He sets about learning Chinese, and after the
lapse of many years, during which his mind subsides into a
certain state of tranquillity, he acquires sufficient knowledge
of Chinese to be able to translate with ease the inscriptions to
be found on its singular crockery.&nbsp; Yes, the laziest of
human beings, through the providence of God&mdash;a being, too,
of rather inferior capacity&mdash;acquires the written part of a
language so difficult that, as Lavengro said on a former
occasion, none but the cleverest people in Europe, the French,
are able to acquire it.&nbsp; But God did not intend that man
should merely acquire Chinese.&nbsp; He intended that he should
be of use to his species, and, by the instrumentality of the
first Chinese inscription which he translates, the one which
first arrested his curiosity, he is taught the duties of
hospitality; yes, by means of an inscription in the language of a
people who have scarcely an idea of hospitality themselves, God
causes the slothful man to play a useful and beneficent part in
the world, relieving distressed wanderers, and, amongst others,
Lavengro himself.&nbsp; But a striking indication of the
man&rsquo;s surprising sloth is still apparent in what he omits
to do; he has learnt Chinese, the most difficult of languages,
and he practises acts of hospitality because he believes himself
enjoined to do so by the Chinese inscription, but he cannot tell
the hour of the day by the clock within his house; he can get on,
he thinks, very well without being able to do so; therefore, from
this one omission, it is easy to come to a conclusion as to what
a sluggard&rsquo;s part the man would have played in life but for
the dispensation of Providence; nothing but extreme agony could
have induced such a man to do anything useful.&nbsp; He still
continues, with all he has acquired, with all his usefulness, and
with all his innocence of character, without any proper sense of
religion, though he has attained a rather advanced age.&nbsp; If
it be observed that this want of religion is a great defect in
the story, the author begs leave to observe that he cannot help
it.&nbsp; Lavengro relates the lives of people so far as they
were placed before him, but no further.&nbsp; It was certainly a
great defect in so good a man to be without religion; it was
likewise a great defect in so learned a man not to be able to
tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is probable that God, in
His loving kindness, will not permit that man to go out of the
world without religion&mdash;who knows but some powerful minister
of the Church, full of zeal for the glory of God, will illumine
that man&rsquo;s dark mind&mdash;perhaps some clergyman will come
to the parish who will visit him and teach him his duty to his
God.&nbsp; Yes, it is very <!-- page 319--><a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>probable
that such a man, before he dies, will have been made to love his
God; whether he will ever learn to know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock is another matter.&nbsp; It is probable that he
will go out of the world without knowing what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is not so necessary to be able to tell
the time of day by the clock as to know one&rsquo;s God through
His inspired word; a man cannot get to heaven without religion,
but a man can get there very comfortably without knowing
what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>But, above all, the care and providence of God are manifested
in the case of Lavengro himself by the manner in which he is
enabled to make his way in the world up to a certain period
without falling a prey either to vice or poverty.&nbsp; In his
history there is a wonderful illustration of part of the text,
quoted by his mother: &lsquo;I have been young, and now am old,
yet never saw I the righteous forsaken or his seed begging
bread.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is the son of good and honourable parents,
but at the critical period of life, that of entering into the
world, he finds himself without any earthly friend to help him,
yet he manages to make his way.&nbsp; He does not become a
captain in the Life Guards, it is true, nor does be get into
Parliament, nor does the last volume conclude in the most
satisfactory and unobjectionable manner by his marrying a dowager
countess&mdash;as that wise man Addison did&mdash;or by his
settling down as a great country gentleman, perfectly happy and
contented, like the very moral Roderick Random or the equally
estimable Peregrine Pickle; he is hack author, gypsy, tinker, and
postillion, yet upon the whole he seems to be quite as happy as
the younger sons of most earls, to have as high feelings of
honour; and, when the reader loses sight of him, he has money in
his pocket honestly acquired to enable him to commence a journey
quite as laudable as those which the younger sons of earls
generally undertake.&nbsp; Surely all this is a manifestation of
the kindness and providence of God, and yet he is not a religious
person&mdash;up to the time when the reader loses sight of him he
is decidedly not a religious person, he has glimpses, it is true,
of that God who does not forsake him, but he prays very seldom,
is not fond of going to church, and, though he admires Tate and
Brady&rsquo;s version of the Psalms, his admiration is rather
caused by the beautiful poetry which that version contains than
the religion; yet his tale is not finished&mdash;like the tale of
the gentleman who touched objects, and that of the old man who
knew Chinese without knowing what was o&rsquo;clock; perhaps,
like them, he is destined to become religious, and to have,
instead of occasional glimpses, frequent and distinct views of
his God; yet, though he may become religious, it is hardly to be
expected that he will become a very precise and straight-laced
person; it is probable that he will retain with his scholarship
something of his gypsyism, his predilection for the hammer and
tongs, and perhaps some inclination to put on <!-- page 320--><a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>certain
gloves, not white kid, with any friend who may be inclined for a
little old English diversion, and a readiness to take a glass of
ale, with plenty of malt in it and as little hop as may well
be&mdash;ale at least two years old&mdash;with the aforesaid
friend when the diversion is over; for, as it is the belief of
the writer that a person may get to heaven very comfortably
without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, so it is his belief
that he will not be refused admission there because to the last
he has been fond of healthy and invigorating exercises, and felt
a willingness to partake of any of the good things which it
pleases the Almighty to put within the reach of His children
during their sojourn upon earth.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;ON PRIESTCRAFT</h3>
<p>The writer will now say a few words about priestcraft and the
machinations of Rome, and will afterwards say something about
himself and his motives for writing against them.</p>
<p>With respect to Rome and her machinations, much valuable
information can be obtained from particular parts of Lavengro and
its sequel.&nbsp; Shortly before the time when the hero of the
book is launched into the world the Popish agitation in England
had commenced.&nbsp; The Popish propaganda had determined to make
a grand attempt on England; Popish priests were scattered over
the land, doing the best they could to make converts to the old
superstition.&nbsp; With the plans of Rome, and her hopes, and
the reasons on which those hopes are grounded, the hero of the
book becomes acquainted during an expedition which he makes into
the country, from certain conversations which he holds with a
priest in a dingle in which the hero had taken up his residence;
he likewise learns from the same person much of the secret
history of the Roman See and many matters connected with the
origin and progress of the Popish superstition.&nbsp; The
individual with whom he holds these conversations is a learned,
intelligent, but highly unprincipled person, of a character,
however, very common amongst the priests of Rome, who in general
are people void of all religion, and who, notwithstanding they
are tied to Rome by a band which they have neither the power nor
wish to break, turn her and her practices, over their cups with
their confidential associates, to a ridicule only exceeded by
that to which they turn those who become the dupes of their
mistress and themselves.</p>
<p>It is now necessary that the writer should say something with
respect to himself and his motives for waging war against
Rome.&nbsp; First of all, with respect to himself, he wishes to
state that, to the <!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 321</span>very last moment of his life, he
will do and say all that in his power may be to hold up to
contempt and execration the priestcraft and practices of Rome;
there is, perhaps, no person better acquainted than himself, not
even among the choicest spirits of the priesthood, with the
origin and history of Popery.&nbsp; From what he saw and heard of
Popery in England at a very early period of his life, his
curiosity was aroused, and he spared himself no trouble, either
by travel or study, to make himself well acquainted with it in
all its phases, the result being a hatred of it which he hopes
and trusts he shall retain till the moment when his spirit quits
the body.&nbsp; Popery is the great lie of the world&mdash;a
source from which more misery and social degradation have flowed
upon the human race than from all the other sources from which
those evils come.&nbsp; It is the oldest of all superstitions,
and, though in Europe it assumes the name of Christianity, it
existed and flourished amidst the Himalayan hills at least two
thousand years before the real Christ was born in Bethlehem of
Judea&mdash;in a word, it is Buddhism, and let those who may be
disposed to doubt this assertion compare the Popery of Rome and
the superstitious practices of its followers with the doings of
the priests who surround the grand Lama, and the mouthings,
bellowing, turnings round, and above all, the penances of the
followers of Buddh with those of Roman devotees.&nbsp; But he is
not going to dwell here on this point; it is dwelt upon at
tolerable length in the text, and has likewise been handled with
extraordinary power by the pen of the gifted but irreligious
Volney; moreover, the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the Roman priesthood
are perfectly well aware that their system is nothing but
Buddhism under a slight disguise, and the European world in
general has entertained for some time past an inkling of the
fact.</p>
<p>And now a few words with respect to the motives of the writer
for expressing a hatred for Rome.</p>
<p>This expressed abhorrence of the author for Rome might be
entitled to little regard, provided it were possible to attribute
it to any self-interested motive.&nbsp; There have been professed
enemies of Rome, or of this or that system; but their professed
enmity may frequently be traced to some cause which does them
little credit; but the writer of these lines has no motive, and
can have no motive, for his enmity to Rome, save the abhorrence
of an honest heart for what is false, base, and cruel.&nbsp; A
certain clergyman wrote with much heat against the Papists in the
time of ---, <a name="citation321a"></a><a href="#footnote321a"
class="citation">[321a]</a> who was known to favour the Papists,
but was not expected to continue long in office, and whose
supposed successor, the person, indeed, who did succeed him, was
thought to be hostile to the Papists.&nbsp; This divine, who
obtained a rich benefice from the successor of ---, <a
name="citation321b"></a><a href="#footnote321b"
class="citation">[321b]</a> who during ---&rsquo;s <a
name="citation321c"></a><a href="#footnote321c"
class="citation">[321c]</a> time <!-- page 322--><a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>had always
opposed him in everything he proposed to do, and who, of course,
during that time affected to be very inimical to
Popery&mdash;this divine might well be suspected of having a
motive equally creditable for writing against the Papists, as
that which induced him to write for them, as soon as his patron,
who eventually did something more for him, had espoused their
cause; but what motive, save an honest one, can the present
writer have, for expressing an abhorrence of Popery?&nbsp; He is
no clergyman, and consequently can expect neither benefices nor
bishoprics, supposing it were the fashion of the present, or
likely to be the fashion of any future administration, to reward
clergymen with benefices or bishoprics, who, in the defence of
the religion of their country write, or shall write, against
Popery, and not to reward those who write, or shall write, in
favour of it, and all its nonsense and abominations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if not a clergyman, he is the servant of a certain
society, which has the overthrow of Popery in view, and
therefore,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; This assertion, which has been
frequently made, is incorrect, even as those who have made it
probably knew it to be.&nbsp; He is the servant of no society
whatever.&nbsp; He eats his own bread, and is one of the very few
men in England who are independent in every sense of the
word.</p>
<p>It is true he went to Spain with the colours of that society
on his hat&mdash;oh! the blood glows in his veins! oh! the marrow
awakes in his old bones when he thinks of what he accomplished in
Spain in the cause of religion and civilization with the colours
of that society in his hat, and its weapon in his hand, even the
sword of the word of God; how with that weapon he hewed left and
right, making the priests fly before him, and run away squeaking:
&lsquo;Vaya! que demonio es este!&rsquo;&nbsp; Ay, and when he
thinks of the plenty of bible swords which he left behind him,
destined to prove, and which have already proved, pretty
calthrops in the heels of popery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Halloo!
Batuschca,&rsquo; <a name="citation322"></a><a
href="#footnote322" class="citation">[322]</a> he exclaimed the
other night, on reading an article in a newspaper, &lsquo;what do
you think of the present doings in Spain?&nbsp; Your old friend
the zingaro, the gitano who rode about Spain, to say nothing of
Galicia, with the Greek Buchini behind him as his squire, had a
hand in bringing them about; there are many brave Spaniards
connected with the present movement who took bibles from his
hands, and read them and profited by them, learning from the
inspired page the duties of one man towards another, and the real
value of a priesthood and their head, who set at nought the word
of God, and think only of their own temporal interests; ay, and
who learned Gitano&mdash;their own Gitano&mdash;from the lips of
the London Calor&oacute;, and also songs in the said Gitano, very
fit to dumbfounder your semi-Buddhist priests when they attempt
<!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>to bewilder people&rsquo;s minds with their
school-logic and pseudo-ecclesiastical nonsense, songs such
as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Un Erajai<br />
Sinaba chibando un sermon . . .&rsquo; <a
name="citation323"></a><a href="#footnote323"
class="citation">[323]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with that society he has long since ceased to have any
connection; he bade it adieu with feelings of love and admiration
more than fourteen years ago; so, in continuing to assault
Popery, no hopes of interest founded on that society can sway his
mind&mdash;interest! who, with worldly interest in view, would
ever have anything to do with that society?&nbsp; It is poor and
supported, like its founder Christ, by poor people; and so far
from having political influence, it is in such disfavour, and has
ever been, with the dastardly great, to whom the government of
England has for many years past been confided, that the having
borne its colours only for a month would be sufficient to exclude
any man, whatever his talents, his learning, or his courage may
be, from the slightest chance of being permitted to serve his
country either for fee, or without.&nbsp; A fellow who unites in
himself the bankrupt trader, the broken author, or rather
book-maker, and the laughed down single speech spouter of the
House of Commons, may look forward always supposing that at one
time he has been a foaming radical, to the government of an
important colony.&nbsp; Ay, an ancient fox who has lost his tail
may, provided he has a score of radical friends, who will swear
that he can bark Chinese, though Chinese is not barked but sung,
be forced upon a Chinese colony, though it is well known that to
have lost one&rsquo;s tail is considered by the Chinese in
general as an irreparable infamy, whilst to have been once
connected with a certain society to which, to its honour be it
said, all the radical party are vehemently hostile, would be
quite sufficient to keep any one not only from a government, but
something much less, even though he could translate the rhymed
&lsquo;Sessions of Hariri,&rsquo; and were versed, still
retaining his tail, in the two languages in which Kien-Loung
wrote his Eulogium on Moukden, that piece which, translated by
Amyot, the learned Jesuit, won the applause of the celebrated
Voltaire.</p>
<p>No! were the author influenced by hopes of fee or reward, he
would, instead of writing against Popery, write for it; all the
trumpery titled&mdash;he will not call them great
again&mdash;would then be for him, and their masters the
radicals, with their hosts of newspapers, would be for him, more
especially if he would commence maligning the society whose
colours he had once on his hat&mdash;a society which, as the
priest says in the text, is one of the very few Protestant
institutions for which the Popish Church entertains any fear, and
consequently respect, as it respects <!-- page 324--><a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>nothing
which it does not fear.&nbsp; The writer said that certain
&lsquo;rulers&rsquo; would never forgive him for having been
connected with that society; he went perhaps too far in saying
&lsquo;never.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is probable that they would take
him into favour on one condition, which is, that he should turn
his pen and his voice against that society; such a mark &lsquo;of
a better way of thinking,&rsquo; would perhaps induce them to
give him a government, nearly as good as that which they gave to
a certain ancient radical fox at the intercession of his radical
friends (who were bound to keep him from the pauper&rsquo;s
kennel), after he had promised to foam, bark, and snarl at
corruption no more; he might even entertain hopes of succeeding,
nay of superseding, the ancient creature in his government; but
even were he as badly off as he is well off, he would do no such
thing.&nbsp; He would rather exist on crusts and water; he has
often done so, and been happy; nay, he would rather starve than
be a rogue&mdash;for even the feeling of starvation is happiness
compared with what he feels who knows himself to be a rogue,
provided he has any feeling at all.&nbsp; What is the use of a
mitre or a knighthood to a man who has betrayed his
principles?&nbsp; What is the use of a gilt collar, nay, even of
a pair of scarlet breeches, to a fox who has lost his tail?&nbsp;
Oh! the horror which haunts the mind of the fox who has lost his
tail; and with reason, for his very mate loathes him, and more
especially if, like himself, she has lost her brush.&nbsp; Oh!
the horror which haunts the mind of the two-legged rogue who has
parted with his principles, or those which he professed&mdash;for
what?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll suppose a government.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s
the use of a government, if, the next day after you have received
it, you are obliged for very shame to scurry off to it with the
hoot of every honest man sounding in your ears?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lightly liar leaped away and
ran.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Piers
Plowman</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But bigotry, it has been said, makes the author write against
Popery; and thorough-going bigotry, indeed, will make a person
say or do anything.&nbsp; But the writer is a very pretty bigot
truly!&nbsp; Where will the public find traces of bigotry in
anything he has written?&nbsp; He has written against Rome with
all his heart, with all his mind, with all his soul, and with all
his strength; but as a person may be quite honest, and speak and
write against Rome, in like manner he may speak and write against
her, and be quite free from bigotry; though it is impossible for
any one but a bigot or a bad man to write or speak in her praise,
her doctrines, actions, and machinations being what they are.</p>
<p>Bigotry!&nbsp; The author was born, and has always continued
in the wrong Church for bigotry, the quiet, unpretending Church
of England&mdash;a Church which had it been a bigoted Church, and
not long suffering almost to a fault, might with its
opportunities, as <!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 325</span>the priest says in the text, have
stood in a very different position from which it occupies at
present.&nbsp; No! let those who are in search of bigotry, seek
for it in a Church very different from the inoffensive Church of
England, which never encourages cruelty or calumny.&nbsp; Let
them seek for it amongst the members of the Church of Rome, and
more especially amongst those who have renegaded to it.&nbsp;
There is nothing, however false and horrible, which a pervert to
Rome will not say for his Church, and which his priests will not
encourage him in saying; and there is nothing, however
horrible&mdash;the more horrible indeed and revolting to human
nature, the more eager he would be to do it&mdash;which he will
not do for it, and which his priests will not encourage him in
doing.</p>
<p>Of the readiness which converts to popery exhibit to sacrifice
all the ties of blood and affection on the shrine of their
newly-adopted religion, there is a curious illustration in the
work of Luigi Pulci.&nbsp; This man, who was born at Florence in
the year 1432, and who was deeply versed in the Bible, composed a
poem, called the &lsquo;Morgante Maggiore,&rsquo; which he
recited at the table of Lorenzo de Medici, the great patron of
Italian genius.&nbsp; It is a mock-heroic and religious poem, in
which the legends of knight-errantry, and of the Popish Church,
are turned to unbounded ridicule.&nbsp; The pretended hero of it
is a converted giant, called Morgante; though his adventures do
not occupy the twentieth part of the poem, the principal
personages being Charlemagne, Orlando, and his cousin Rinaldo of
Montalban.&nbsp; Morgante has two brothers, both of them giants,
and, in the first canto of the poem, Morgante is represented with
his brothers as carrying on a feud with the abbot and monks of a
certain convent, built upon the confines of heathenesse; the
giants being in the habit of flinging down stones, or rather huge
rocks, on the convent.&nbsp; Orlando, however, who is banished
from the court of Charlemagne, arriving at the convent,
undertakes to destroy them, and, accordingly, kills Passamonte
and Alabastro, and converts Morgante, whose mind had been
previously softened by a vision, in which the &lsquo;Blessed
Virgin&rsquo; figures.&nbsp; No sooner is he converted than, as a
sign of his penitence, what does he do but hastens and cuts off
the hands of his two brothers, saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Io vo&rsquo; tagliar le mani a tutti
quanti<br />
E porterolle a que&rsquo; monaci santi.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he does cut off the hands of his brethren, and carries
them to the abbot, who blesses him for so doing.&nbsp; Pulci here
is holding up to ridicule and execration the horrid butchery or
betrayal of friends by popish converts, and the encouragement
they receive from the priest.&nbsp; No sooner is a person
converted to popery than his principal thought is how he can
bring the <!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>hands and feet of his brethren,
however harmless they may be, and different from the giants, to
the &lsquo;holy priests,&rsquo; who, if he manages to do so,
never fail to prate him, saying to the miserable wretch, as the
abbot said to Morgante:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Tu sarai or perfetto e vero amico<br />
A Cristo, quanto tu gli eri nemico.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can the English public deny the justice of Pulci&rsquo;s
illustration, after something which it has lately witnessed? <a
name="citation326"></a><a href="#footnote326"
class="citation">[326]</a>&nbsp; Has it not seen equivalents for
the hands and feet of brothers carried by popish perverts to the
&lsquo;holy priests&rsquo;? and has it not seen the manner in
which the offering his been received?&nbsp; Let those who are in
quest of bigotry seek for it amongst the perverts to Rome, and
not amongst those who, born in the pale of the Church of England,
have always continued in it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;ON FOREIGN NONSENSE</h2>
<p>With respect to the third point, various lessons which the
book reads to the nation at large, and which it would be well for
the nation to ponder and profit by.</p>
<p>There are many species of nonsense to which the nation is much
addicted, and of which the perusal of Lavengro ought to give them
a wholesome shame.&nbsp; First of all, with respect to the
foreign nonsense so prevalent now in England.&nbsp; The hero is a
scholar, but, though possessed of a great many tongues, he
affects to be neither Frenchman, nor German, nor this or that
foreigner; he is one who loves his country, and the language and
literature of his country, and speaks up for each and all when
there is occasion to do so.&nbsp; Now, what is the case with nine
out of ten amongst those of the English who study foreign
languages?&nbsp; No sooner have they picked up a smattering of
this or that speech than they begin to abuse their own country
and everything connected with it, more especially its
language.&nbsp; This is particularly the case with those who call
themselves German students.&nbsp; It is said, and the writer
believes with truth, that when a woman falls in love with a
particularly ugly fellow, she squeezes him with ten times more
zest than she would a handsome one if captivated by him.&nbsp; So
it is with these German students; no sooner have they taken
German in hand than there is nothing like German.&nbsp; Oh, the
dear delightful German!&nbsp; How proud I am that it is now my
own, and that its divine literature is within my reach!&nbsp; And
all this whilst mumbling the most uncouth <!-- page 327--><a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>speech, and
crunching the most crabbed literature in Europe.&nbsp; The writer
is not an exclusive admirer of everything English; he does not
advise his country people never to go abroad, never to study
foreign languages, and he does not wish to persuade them that
there is nothing beautiful or valuable in foreign literature; he
only wishes that they would not make themselves fools with
respect to foreign people, foreign languages or reading; that if
they chance to have been in Spain, and have picked up a little
Spanish, they would not affect the arts of Spaniards; that, if
males they would not make Tom-fools of themselves by sticking
cigars into their mouths, dressing themselves in zamarras, and
saying &lsquo;Carajo!&rsquo; <a name="citation327"></a><a
href="#footnote327" class="citation">[327]</a> and, if females,
that they would not make zanies of themselves by sticking cigars
into their mouths, flinging mantillas over their heads, and by
saying, &lsquo;Carai,&rsquo; and perhaps &lsquo;Carajo&rsquo;
too; or if they have been in France or Italy, and have picked up
a little French or Italian, they would not affect to be French or
Italians; and particularly, after having been a month or two in
Germany, or picked up a little German in England, they would not
make themselves foolish about everything German, as the
Anglo-German in the book does&mdash;a real character, the founder
of the Anglo-German school in England, and the cleverest
Englishman who ever talked or wrote encomiastic nonsense about
Germany and the Germans.&nbsp; Of all infatuations connected with
what is foreign, the infatuation about everything that is German,
to a certain extent prevalent in England, is assuredly the most
ridiculous.&nbsp; One can find something like a palliation for
people making themselves somewhat foolish about particular
languages, literatures, and people.&nbsp; The Spanish certainly
is a noble language, and there is something wild and captivating
in the Spanish character, and its literature contains the grand
book of the world.&nbsp; French is a manly language.&nbsp; The
French are the most martial people in the world; and French
literature is admirable in many respects.&nbsp; Italian is a
sweet language, and of beautiful simplicity; its literature,
perhaps, the first in the world.&nbsp; The
Italians!&mdash;wonderful men have sprung up in Italy.&nbsp;
Italy is not merely famous for painters, poets, musicians,
singers, and linguists&mdash;the greatest linguist the world ever
saw, the late Cardinal Mezzofanti, was an Italian; but it is
celebrated for men&mdash;men emphatically speaking: Columbus was
in Italian, Alexander Farnese was an Italian, so was the
mightiest of the mighty, Napoleon Bonaparte.&nbsp; But the German
language, German literature, and the Germans!&nbsp; The writer
has already stated his opinion with respect to German; he does
not speak from ignorance or prejudice; he has heard German
spoken, and many other languages.&nbsp; German literature! he
does not speak from ignorance; he has read that and many a
literature, and he repeats&mdash;<!-- page 328--><a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>however, he
acknowledges that there is one fine poem in the German language;
that poem is the &lsquo;Oberon&rsquo;&mdash;a poem, by-the-by,
ignored by the Germans&mdash;a speaking fact&mdash;and, of
course, by the Anglo-Germanists.&nbsp; The Germans! he has been
amongst them, and amongst many other nations, and confesses that
his opinion of the Germans, as men, is a very low one.&nbsp;
Germany, it is true, has produced one very great man, the monk
who fought the Pope, and nearly knocked him down; but this man
his countrymen&mdash;a telling fact&mdash;affect to despise, and,
of course, the Anglo-Germanists.&nbsp; The father of
Anglo-Germanism was very fond of inveighing against Luther.</p>
<p>The madness, or rather foolery, of the English for foreign
customs, dresses, and languages, is not an affair of to-day, or
yesterday&mdash;it is of very ancient date, and was very properly
exposed nearly three centuries ago by one Andrew Borde, who,
under the picture of a &lsquo;Naked man, with a pair of shears in
one hand and a roll of cloth in the other,&rsquo; <a
name="citation328"></a><a href="#footnote328"
class="citation">[328]</a> inserted the following lines along
with others:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am an Englishman, and naked I stand
here,<br />
Musing in my mind what garment I shall weare;<br />
For now I will weare this, and now I will weare that,<br />
Now I will weare, I cannot tell what.<br />
All new fashions be pleasant to mee,<br />
I will have them, whether I thrive or thee;<br />
What do I care if all the world me fail?<br />
I will have a garment reach to my taille;<br />
Then am I a minion, for I wear the new guise.<br />
The next yeare after I hope to be wise,<br />
Not only in wearing my gorgeous array,<br />
For I will go to learning a whole summer&rsquo;s day;<br />
I will learn Latine, Hebrew, Greek, and French,<br />
And I will learn Dutch, sitting on my bench.<br />
I had no peere if to myself I were true,<br />
Because I am not so, divers times do I rue.<br />
Yet I lacke nothing, I have all things at will<br />
If I were wise and would hold myself still,<br />
And meddle with no matters but to me pertaining,<br />
But ever to be true to God and my king.<br />
But I have such matters rowling in my pate,<br />
That I will and do . . . I cannot tell what,&rsquo; etc.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 329</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>ON GENTILITY, NONSENSE&mdash;ILLUSTRATIONS OF GENTILITY</p>
<p>What is gentility?&nbsp; People in different stations in
England entertain different ideas of what is genteel, <a
name="citation329"></a><a href="#footnote329"
class="citation">[329]</a> but it must be something gorgeous,
glittering, or tawdry to be considered genteel by any of
them.&nbsp; The beau-ideal of the English aristocracy, of course
with some exceptions, is some young fellow with an imperial
title, a military personage, of course, for what is military is
so particularly genteel, with flaming epaulets, a cocked hat and
a plume, a prancing charger, and a band of fellows called
generals and colonels, with flaming epaulets, cocked hats, and
plumes, and prancing chargers vapouring behind him.&nbsp; It was
but lately that the daughter of an English marquis was heard to
say that the sole remaining wish of her heart&mdash;she had known
misfortunes, and was not far from fifty&mdash;was to be
introduced to&mdash;whom?&nbsp; The Emperor of Austria!&nbsp; The
sole remaining wish of the heart of one who ought to have been
thinking of the grave and judgment was to be introduced to the
miscreant who had caused the blood of noble Hungarian females to
be whipped out of their shoulders, for no other crime than
devotion to their country and its tall and heroic sons.&nbsp; The
middle classes&mdash;of course there are some
exceptions&mdash;admire the aristocracy, and consider them pinks,
the aristocracy who admire the Emperor of Austria, and adored the
Emperor of Russia till he became old, ugly, and unfortunate, when
their adoration instantly terminated; for what is more ungenteel
than age, ugliness, and misfortune!&nbsp; The beau-ideal with
those of the <!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 330</span>lower classes, with peasants and
mechanics, is some flourishing railroad contractor&mdash;look,
for example, how they worship Mr. Flamson. <a
name="citation330"></a><a href="#footnote330"
class="citation">[330]</a>&nbsp; This person makes his grand
d&eacute;but in the year &rsquo;39, at a public meeting in the
principal room of a country inn.&nbsp; He has come into the
neighbourhood with the character of a man worth a million pounds
who is to make everybody&rsquo;s fortune; at this time, however,
he is not worth a shilling of his own, though he flashes about
dexterously three or four thousand pounds, part of which sum he
has obtained by specious pretences, and part from certain
individuals who are his confederates.&nbsp; But in the year
&rsquo;49 he is really in possession of the fortune which he and
his agents pretended he was worth ten years before&mdash;he is
worth a million pounds.&nbsp; By what means has he come by
them?&nbsp; By railroad contracts, for which he takes care to be
paid in hard cash before he attempts to perform them, and to
carry out which he makes use of the sweat and blood of wretches
who, since their organization, have introduced crimes and
language into England to which it was previously almost a
stranger&mdash;by purchasing, with paper, shares by hundreds in
the schemes to execute which he contracts, and which are of his
own devising; which shares he sells as soon as they are at a high
premium, to which they are speedily forced by means of
paragraphs, inserted by himself and agents, in newspapers devoted
to his interest, utterly reckless of the terrible depreciation to
which they are almost instantly subjected.&nbsp; But he is worth
a million pounds, there can be no doubt of the fact&mdash;he has
not made people&rsquo;s fortunes, at least, those whose fortunes
it was said he would make; he has made them away, but his own he
has made, emphatically made it&mdash;he is worth a million
pounds.&nbsp; Hurrah for the millionaire!&nbsp; The clown who
views the pandemonium of red brick which he has built on the
estate which he has purchased in the neighbourhood of the place
of his grand d&eacute;but, in which every species of
architecture, Greek, Indian, and Chinese, is employed in
caricature&mdash;who hears of the grand entertainment he gives at
Christmas in the principal dining-room, the hundred wax candles,
the waggon-load of plate, and the oceans of wine which form parts
of it, and above all the two ostrich poults, one at the head and
the other at the foot of the table, exclaims: &lsquo;Well, if he
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t bang up, I don&rsquo;t know who be; why he
beats my lord hollow!&rsquo;&nbsp; The mechanic of the borough
town, who sees him dashing through the streets in an open landau,
drawn by four milk-white horses, amidst its attendant out-riders;
his wife, a monster of a woman, by his side, stout as the wife of
Tamerlane, who weighed twenty stone, and bedizened out like her
whose person shone with the jewels of plundered Persia, stares
with silent wonder, and at last exclaims: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the
man for my vote!&rsquo;&nbsp; You tell the clown that the man of
the mansion <!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>has contributed enormously to
corrupt the rural innocence of England; you point to an incipient
branch railroad, from around which the accents of Gomorrah are
sounding, and beg him to listen for a moment and then close his
ears.&nbsp; Hodge scratches his head and says: &lsquo;Well, I
have nothing to say to that; all I know is that he is bang up,
and I wish I were he&rsquo;; perhaps he will add&mdash;a Hodge
has been known to add&mdash;&lsquo;He has been kind enough to put
my son on that very railroad; &rsquo;tis true the company is
somewhat queer, and the work rather killing; but he gets there
half-a-crown a day, whereas from the farmers he would only get
eighteenpence.&rsquo;&nbsp; You remind the mechanic that the man
in the landau has been the ruin of thousands, and you mention
people whom he himself knows, people in various grades of life,
widows and orphans amongst them, whose little all he has
dissipated, and whom he has reduced to beggary by inducing them
to become sharers in his delusive schemes.&nbsp; But the mechanic
says: &lsquo;Well the more fools they to let themselves be
robbed.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t call that kind of thing robbery,
I merely call it out-witting; and everybody in this free country
has a right to outwit others if he can.&nbsp; What a turn-out he
has!&rsquo;&nbsp; One was once heard to add, &lsquo;I never saw a
more genteel-looking man in all my life except one, and that was
a gentleman&rsquo;s walley, who was much like him.&nbsp; It is
true he is rather undersized, but then madam, you know, makes up
for all.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;SUBJECT OF GENTILITY CONTINUED</h2>
<p>In the last chapter have been exhibited specimens of
gentility, so considered by different classes; by one class,
power, youth, and epaulets are considered the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of gentility; by another class, pride, stateliness, and
title; by another, wealth and flaming tawdriness.&nbsp; But what
constitutes a gentleman?&nbsp; It is easy to say at once what
constitutes a gentleman, and there are no distinctions in what is
gentlemanly, <a name="citation331"></a><a href="#footnote331"
class="citation">[331]</a> as there are in what is genteel.&nbsp;
The characteristics of a gentleman are high feeling, a
determination never to take a cowardly advantage of another, a
liberal education, absence of narrow views, generosity and
courage, propriety of behaviour.&nbsp; Now a person may be
genteel according to one or another of the three standards
described above, and not possess one of the characteristics <!--
page 332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>of a gentleman.&nbsp; Is the Emperor a gentleman, with
spatters of blood on his clothes, scourged from the backs of
noble Hungarian women?&nbsp; Are the aristocracy gentlefolks, who
admire him?&nbsp; Is Mr. Flamson a gentleman, although he has a
million pounds?&nbsp; No! cowardly miscreants, admirers of
cowardly miscreants, and people who make a million pounds by
means compared with which those employed to make fortunes by the
getters-up of the South Sea Bubble might be called honest
dealing, are decidedly not gentle-folks.&nbsp; Now, as it is
clearly demonstrable that a person may be perfectly genteel
according to some standard or other and yet be no gentleman, so
is it demonstrable that a person may have no pretensions to
gentility and yet be a gentleman.&nbsp; For example there is
Lavengro!&nbsp; Would the admirers of the Emperor, or the
admirers of those who admire the Emperor, or the admirers of Mr.
Flamson, call him genteel?&mdash;and gentility with them is
everything!&nbsp; Assuredly they would not; and assuredly they
would consider him respectively as a being to be shunned,
despised, or hooted.&nbsp; Genteel!&nbsp; Why, at one time he is
a hack author&mdash;writes reviewals for eighteenpence a
page&mdash;edits a Newgate chronicle.&nbsp; At another he wanders
the country with a face grimy from occasionally mending kettles;
and there is no evidence that his clothes are not seedy and torn,
and his shoes down at the heel; but by what process of reasoning
will they prove that he is no gentleman!&nbsp; Is he not
learned?&nbsp; Has he not generosity and courage?&nbsp; Whilst a
hack author does he pawn the books entrusted to him to
review?&nbsp; Does he break his word to his publisher?&nbsp; Does
he write begging letters?&nbsp; Does he get clothes or lodgings
without paying for them?&nbsp; Again, whilst a wanderer, does he
insult helpless women on the road with loose proposals or ribald
discourse?&nbsp; Does he take what is not his own from the
hedges?&nbsp; Does he play on the fiddle, or make faces in
public-houses, in order to obtain pence or beer? or does he call
for liquor, swallow it, and then say to a widowed landlady,
&lsquo;Mistress, I have no brass&rsquo;?&nbsp; In a word, what
vice and crime does he perpetrate&mdash;what low acts does he
commit?&nbsp; Therefore, with his endowments, who will venture to
say that he is no gentleman?&mdash;unless it be an admirer of Mr.
Flamson&mdash;a clown&mdash;who will, perhaps, shout: &lsquo;I
say he is no gentleman; for who can be a gentleman who keeps no
gig?&rsquo; <a name="citation332"></a><a href="#footnote332"
class="citation">[332]</a></p>
<p>The indifference exhibited by Lavengro for what is merely
genteel, compared with his solicitude never to infringe the
strict laws of honour, should read a salutary lesson.&nbsp; The
generality of his countrymen are far more careful not to
transgress the customs of what they call gentility than to
violate the laws of honour or morality.&nbsp; They will shrink
<!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>from carrying their own carpet-bag, and from speaking
to a person in seedy raiment, whilst to matters of much higher
importance they are shamelessly indifferent.&nbsp; Not so
Lavengro; he will do anything that he deems convenient, or which
strikes his fancy, provided it does not outrage decency, or is
unallied to profligacy; is not ashamed to speak to a beggar in
rags, and will associate with anybody, provided he can gratify a
laudable curiosity.&nbsp; He has no abstract love for what is
low, or what the world calls low.&nbsp; He sees that many things
which the world looks down upon are valuable, so he prizes much
which the world contemns; he sees that many things which the
world admires are contemptible, so he despises much which the
world does not; but when the world prizes what is really
excellent, he does not contemn it, because the world regards
it.&nbsp; If he learns Irish, which all the world scoffs at, he
likewise learns Italian, which all the world melts at.&nbsp; If
he learns Gypsy, the language of the tattered tent, he likewise
learns Greek, the language of the college hall.&nbsp; If he
learns smithery, he also learns&mdash;ah! what does he learn to
set against smithery?&mdash;the law?&nbsp; No; he does not learn
the law, which, by the way, is not very genteel.&nbsp;
Swimming!&nbsp; Yes, he learns to swim.&nbsp; Swimming, however,
is not genteel; and the world&mdash;at least the genteel part of
it&mdash;acts very wisely in setting its face against it; for to
swim you must be naked, and how would many a genteel person look
without his clothes?&nbsp; Come, he learns horsemanship; a very
genteel accomplishment, which every genteel person would gladly
possess, though not all genteel people do.</p>
<p>Again as to associates: if he holds communion when a boy with
Murtagh, the scarecrow of an Irish academy, he associates in
after life with Francis Ardry, a rich and talented young Irish
gentleman about town.&nbsp; If he accepts an invitation from Mr.
Petulengro to his tent, he has no objection to go home with a
rich genius to dinner; who then will say that he prizes a thing
or a person because they are ungenteel?&nbsp; That he is not
ready to take up with everything that is ungenteel he gives a
proof, when he refuses, though on the brink of starvation, to
become bonnet to the thimble-man, an office which, though
profitable, is positively ungenteel.&nbsp; Ah! but some
sticker-up for gentility will exclaim, &lsquo;The hero did not
refuse this office from an insurmountable dislike to its
ungentility, but merely from a feeling of principle.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well! the writer is not fond of argument, and he will admit that
such was the case; he admits that it was a love of principle,
rather than an over-regard for gentility, which prevented the
hero from accepting, when on the brink of starvation, an
ungenteel though lucrative office, an office which, the writer
begs leave to observe, many a person with a great regard for
gentility, and no particular regard for principle, would in a
similar strait have accepted; for when did a mere love for <!--
page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>gentility keep a person from being a dirty scoundrel,
when the alternatives apparently were &lsquo;either be a dirty
scoundrel or starve&rsquo;?&nbsp; One thing, however, is certain,
which is, that Lavengro did not accept the office, which if a
love for what is low had been his ruling passion he certainly
would have done; consequently, he refuses to do one thing which
no genteel person would willingly do, even as he does many things
which every genteel person would gladly do, for example speaks
Italian, rides on horseback, associates with a fashionable young
man, dines with a rich genius, et cetera.&nbsp; Yet&mdash;and it
cannot be minced&mdash;he and gentility with regard to many
things are at strange divergency; he shrinks from many things at
which gentility placidly hums a tune, or approvingly simpers, and
does some things at which gentility positively sinks.&nbsp; He
will not run into debt for clothes or lodgings, which he might do
without any scandal to gentility; he will not receive money from
Francis Ardry, and go to Brighton with the sister of Annette Le
Noir, though there is nothing ungenteel in borrowing money from a
friend, even when you never intend to repay him, and something
poignantly genteel in going to a watering-place with a gay young
Frenchwoman; but he has no objection, after raising twenty pounds
by the sale of that extraordinary work &lsquo;Joseph Sell,&rsquo;
to set off into the country, mend kettles under hedgerows, and
make pony and donkey shoes in a dingle.&nbsp; Here, perhaps, some
plain, well-meaning person will cry&mdash;and with much apparent
justice&mdash;how can the writer justify him in this act?&nbsp;
What motive, save a love for what is low, could induce him to do
such things?&nbsp; Would the writer have everybody who is in need
of recreation go into the country, mend kettles under hedges, and
make pony shoes in dingles?&nbsp; To such an observation the
writer would answer that Lavengro had an excellent motive in
doing what he did, but that the writer is not so unreasonable as
to wish everybody to do the same.&nbsp; It is not everybody who
can mend kettles.&nbsp; It is not everybody who is in similar
circumstances to those in which Lavengro was.&nbsp; Lavengro
flies from London and hack authorship, and takes to the roads
from fear of consumption; it is expensive to put up at inns, and
even at public-houses, and Lavengro has not much money; so he
buys a tinker&rsquo;s cart and apparatus, and sets up as tinker,
and subsequently as blacksmith; a person living in a tent, or in
anything else, must do something or go mad; Lavengro had a mind,
as he himself well knew, with some slight tendency to madness,
and had he not employed himself, he must have gone wild; so to
employ himself he drew upon one of his resources, the only one
available at the time.&nbsp; Authorship had nearly killed him, he
was sick of reading, and had besides no books; but he possessed
the rudiments of an art akin to tinkering; he knew something of
smithery, having served a kind of apprenticeship in Ireland <!--
page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>to a fairy smith; so he draws upon his smithery to
enable him to acquire tinkering, and through the help which it
affords him, owing to its connection with tinkering, he speedily
acquires that craft, even as he had speedily acquired Welsh,
owing to its connection with Irish, which language he possessed;
and with tinkering he amuses himself until he lays it aside to
resume smithery.&nbsp; A man who has any innocent resource, has
quite as much right to draw upon it in need, as he has upon a
banker in whose hands he has placed a sum; Lavengro turns to
advantage, under particular circumstances, a certain resource
which he has, but people who are not so forlorn as Lavengro, and
have not served the same apprenticeship which he had, are not
advised to follow his example.&nbsp; Surely he was better
employed in plying the trades of tinker and smith than in having
recourse to vice, in running after milk-maids for example.&nbsp;
Running after milk-maids is by no means an ungenteel rural
diversion; but let any one ask some respectable casuist (the
Bishop of London for example), whether Lavengro was not far
better employed, when in the country, at tinkering and smithery
than he would have been in running after all the milkmaids in
Cheshire, though tinkering is in general considered a very
ungenteel employment, and smithery little better, notwithstanding
that an Orcadian poet, who wrote in Norse about eight hundred
years ago, reckons the latter amongst nine noble arts which he
possessed, naming it along with playing at chess, on the harp,
and ravelling runes, or as the original has it &lsquo;treading
runes&rsquo;&mdash;that is compressing them into a small compass
by mingling one letter with another, even as the Turkish
caligraphists ravel the Arabic letters, more especially those who
write talismans.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nine arts have I, all noble;<br />
I play at chess so free,<br />
At ravelling runes I&rsquo;m ready,<br />
At books and smithery;<br />
I&rsquo;m skill&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er ice at skimming<br />
On skates, I shoot and row,<br />
And few at harping match me,<br />
Or minstrelsy, I trow.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But though Lavengro takes up smithery, which, though the
Orcadian ranks it with chess-playing and harping, is certainly
somewhat of a grimy art, there can be no doubt that, had he been
wealthy and not so forlorn as he was, he would have turned to
many things, honourable, of course, in preference.&nbsp; He has
no objection to ride a fine horse when he has the opportunity: he
has his day-dream of making a fortune of two hundred thousand
pounds by becoming a merchant and doing business after the
Armenian fashion; and there can be no doubt that he would have
been glad to wear fine clothes, provided he <!-- page 336--><a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>had had
sufficient funds to authorize him in wearing them.&nbsp; For the
sake of wandering the country and plying the hammer and tongs he
would not have refused a commission in the service of that
illustrious monarch George the Fourth, provided he had thought
that he could live on his pay, and not be forced to run in debt
to tradesmen, without any hope of paying them, for clothes and
luxuries, as many highly genteel officers in that honourable
service were in the habit of doing.&nbsp; For the sake of
tinkering he would certainly not have refused a secretaryship of
an embassy to Persia, in which he might have turned his
acquaintance with Persian, Arabic, and the Lord only knows what
other languages, to account.&nbsp; He took to tinkering and
smithery, because no better employments were at his
command.&nbsp; No war is waged in the book against rank, wealth,
fine clothes, or dignified employments; it is shown, however,
that a person may be a gentleman and a scholar without
them.&nbsp; Rank, wealth, fine clothes, and dignified
employments, are no doubt very fine things, but they are merely
externals, they do not make a gentleman, they add external grace
and dignity to the gentleman and scholar, but they make neither;
and is it not better to be a gentleman without them than not a
gentleman with them?&nbsp; Is not Lavengro, when he leaves London
on foot with twenty pounds in his pocket, entitled to more
respect than Mr. Flamson flaming in his coach with a
million?&nbsp; And is not even the honest jockey at Horncastle,
who offers a fair price to Lavengro for his horse, entitled to
more than the scoundrel lord, who attempts to cheat him of
one-fourth of its value.</p>
<p>Millions, however, seem to think otherwise, by their servile
adoration of people whom, without rank, wealth, and fine clothes,
they would consider infamous; but whom, possessed of rank,
wealth, and glittering habiliments, they seem to admire all the
more for their profligacy and crimes.&nbsp; Does not a blood-spot
or a lust-spot on the clothes of a blooming emperor give a kind
of zest to the genteel young god?&nbsp; Do not the pride,
superciliousness, and selfishness of a certain aristocracy make
it all the more regarded by its worshippers?&nbsp; And do not the
clownish and gutter-blood admirers of Mr. Flamson like him all
the more because they are conscious that he is a knave?&nbsp; If
such is the case&mdash;and, alas! is it not the case?&mdash;they
cannot be too frequently told that fine clothes, wealth, and
titles adorn a person in proportion as he adorns them; that if
worn by the magnanimous and good they are ornaments indeed, but
if by the vile and profligate they are merely san benitos, and
only serve to make their infamy doubly apparent; and that a
person in seedy raiment and tattered hat, possessed of courage,
kindness, and virtue, is entitled to more respect from those to
whom his virtues are manifested than any cruel profligate
emperor, selfish aristocrat, or knavish millionaire in the
world.</p>
<p><!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>The writer has no intention of saying that all in
England are affected with the absurd mania for gentility; nor is
such a statement made in the book; it is shown therein that
individuals of various classes can prize a gentleman,
notwithstanding seedy raiment, dusty shoes, or tattered
hat&mdash;for example, the young Irishman, the rich genius, the
postillion, and his employer.&nbsp; Again, when the life of the
hero is given to the world, amidst the howl about its lowness and
vulgarity, raised by the servile crew whom its independence of
sentiment has stung, more than one powerful voice has been heard
testifying approbation of its learning and the purity of its
morality.&nbsp; That there is some salt in England&mdash;minds
not swayed by mere externals&mdash;he is fully convinced; if he
were not, he would spare himself the trouble of writing; but to
the fact that the generality of his countrymen are basely
grovelling before the shrine of what they are pleased to call
gentility he cannot shut his eyes.</p>
<p>Oh! what a clever person that Cockney was, who, travelling in
the Aberdeen railroad carriage, after edifying the company with
his remarks on various subjects, gave it as his opinion that
Lieutenant P--- <a name="citation337"></a><a href="#footnote337"
class="citation">[337]</a> would, in future, be shunned by all
respectable society!&nbsp; And what a simple person that elderly
gentleman was, who, abruptly starting, asked, in rather an
authoritative voice, &lsquo;And why should Lieutenant P--- be
shunned by respectable society?&rsquo; and who, after entering
into what was said to be a masterly analysis of the entire
evidence of the case, concluded by stating, &lsquo;that having
been accustomed to all kinds of evidence all his life, he had
never known a case in which the accused had obtained a more
complete and triumphant justification than Lieutenant P--- had
done in the late trial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, the Cockney, who is said to have been a very foppish
Cockney, was perfectly right in what he said, and therein
manifested a knowledge of the English mind and character, and
likewise of the modern English language, to which his catechist,
who, it seems, was a distinguished member of the Scottish Bar,
could lay no pretensions.&nbsp; The Cockney knew what the Lord of
Session knew not&mdash;that the British public is gentility
crazy&mdash;and he knew, moreover, that gentility and
respectability are synonymous.&nbsp; No one in England is genteel
or respectable that is &lsquo;looked at,&rsquo; who is the victim
of oppression.&nbsp; He may be pitied for a time, but when did
not pity terminate in contempt?&nbsp; A poor, harmless young
officer!&mdash;but why enter into the details of the infamous
case?&nbsp; They are but too well known, and if ever, cruelty,
pride, and cowardice, and things much worse than even cruelty,
cowardice, and pride, were brought to light, and at the same time
countenanced, they were in that case.&nbsp; What availed the
triumphant justification of the poor victim?&nbsp; There was at
first a roar of indignation against his oppressors, but how <!--
page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>long did it last?&nbsp; He had been turned out of the
service, they remained in it with their red coats and epaulets;
he was merely the son of a man who had rendered good service to
his country, they were, for the most part, highly connected; they
were in the extremest degree genteel, he quite the reverse.&nbsp;
So the nation wavered, considered, thought the genteel side was
the safest after all, and then, with the cry of, &lsquo;Oh, there
is nothing like gentility,&rsquo; ratted bodily.&nbsp; Newspaper
and public turned against the victim, scouted him, apologized for
the&mdash;what should they be called?&mdash;who were not only
admitted into the most respectable society, but courted to come,
the spots, not merely of wine, on their military clothes giving
them a kind of poignancy.&nbsp; But there is a God in heaven; the
British glories are tarnished&mdash;Providence has never smiled
on British arms since that case&mdash;oh, Balaklava! thy name
interpreted is net of fishes, and well dost thou deserve that
name.&nbsp; How many a scarlet golden fish has of late perished
in the mud amidst thee, cursing the genteel service and the
genteel leader which brought him to such a doom!</p>
<p>Whether the rage for gentility is most prevalent amongst the
upper, middle, or lower classes it is difficult to say; the
priest, in the text, seems to think that it is exhibited in the
most decided manner in the middle class; it is the writer&rsquo;s
opinion, however, that in no class is it more strongly developed
than in the lower; what they call being well born goes a great
way amongst them, but the possession of money much farther,
whence Mr. Flamson&rsquo;s influence over them.&nbsp; Their rage
against, and scorn for, any person who by his courage and talents
has advanced himself in life, and still remains poor, are
indescribable: &lsquo;He is no better than ourselves,&rsquo; they
say; &lsquo;why should he be above us?&rsquo;&nbsp; For they have
no conception that anybody has a right to ascendancy over
themselves except by birth or money.&nbsp; This feeling amongst
the vulgar has been, to a certain extent, the bane of the two
services, naval and military.&nbsp; The writer does not make this
assertion rashly; he observed this feeling at work in the army
when a child, and he has good reason for believing that it was as
strongly at work in the navy at the same time, and is still as
prevalent in both.&nbsp; Why are not brave men raised from the
ranks? is frequently the cry; why are not brave sailors
promoted?&nbsp; The Lord help brave soldiers and sailors who are
promoted!&nbsp; They have less to undergo from the high airs of
their brother-officers, and those are hard enough to endure, than
from the insolence of the men.&nbsp; Soldiers and sailors
promoted to command are said to be in general tyrants; in nine
cases out of ten, when they are tyrants, they have been obliged
to have recourse to extreme severity in order to protect
themselves from the insolence and mutinous spirit of the men:
&lsquo;He is no better than ourselves; shoot him, bayonet him, or
fling him overboard!&rsquo; <!-- page 339--><a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>they say of
some obnoxious individual raised above them by his merit.&nbsp;
Soldiers and sailors, in general, will bear any amount of tyranny
from a lordly sot, or the son of a man who has &lsquo;plenty of
brass&rsquo;&mdash;their own term&mdash;but will mutiny against
the just orders of a skilful and brave officer who &lsquo;is no
better than themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was the affair of the
<i>Bounty</i>, for example: Bligh was one of the best seamen that
ever trod deck, and one of the bravest of men; proofs of his
seamanship he gave by steering, amidst dreadful weather, a
deeply-laden boat for nearly four thousand miles over an almost
unknown ocean; of his bravery at the fight of Copenhagen, one of
the most desperate ever fought, of which, after Nelson, he was
the hero; he was, moreover, not an unkind man; but the crew of
the <i>Bounty</i> mutinied against him, and set him, half-naked,
in an open boat, with certain of his men who remained faithful to
him, and ran away with the ship.&nbsp; Their principal motive for
doing so was an idea, whether true or groundless the writer
cannot say, that Bligh was &lsquo;no better than
themselves&rsquo;; he was certainly neither a lord&rsquo;s
illegitimate, nor possessed of twenty thousand pounds.&nbsp; The
writer knows what he is writing about, having been acquainted in
his early years with an individual who was turned adrift with
Bligh, and who died about the year &rsquo;22, a lieutenant in the
navy, in a provincial town in which the writer was brought
up.&nbsp; The ringleaders in the mutiny were two scoundrels,
Christian and Young, who had great influence with the crew,
because they were genteelly connected.&nbsp; Bligh, after leaving
the <i>Bounty</i>, had considerable difficulty in managing the
men who had shared his fate, because they considered themselves
&lsquo;as good men as he,&rsquo; notwithstanding that to his
conduct and seamanship they had alone to look, under heaven, for
salvation from the ghastly perils that surrounded them.&nbsp;
Bligh himself, in his journal, alludes to this feeling.&nbsp;
Once, when he and his companions landed on a desert island, one
of them said, with a mutinous look, that he considered himself
&lsquo;as good a man as he&rsquo;; Bligh, seizing a cutlass,
called upon him to take another and defend himself, whereupon the
man said that Bligh was going to kill him, and made all manner of
concessions.&nbsp; Now, why did this fellow consider himself as
good a man as Bligh?&nbsp; Was he as good a seaman?&nbsp; No, nor
a tenth part as good.&nbsp; As brave a man?&nbsp; No, nor a tenth
part as brave; and of these facts he was perfectly well aware,
but bravery and seamanship stood for nothing with him, as they
still stand with thousands of his class.&nbsp; Bligh was not
genteel by birth or money, therefore Bligh was no better than
himself.&nbsp; Had Bligh, before he sailed, got a twenty thousand
pound prize in the lottery, he would have experienced no
insolence from this fellow, for there would have been no mutiny
in the <i>Bounty</i>.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is our betters,&rsquo; the
crew would have said, &lsquo;and it is our duty to obey
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>The wonderful power of gentility in England is
exemplified in nothing more than in what it is producing amongst
Jews, gypsies, and Quakers.&nbsp; It is breaking up their
venerable communities.&nbsp; All the better, someone will
say.&nbsp; Alas! alas!&nbsp; It is making the wealthy Jews
forsake the synagogue for the opera-house, or the gentility
chapel, in which a disciple of Mr. Platitude, in a white
surplice, preaches a sermon at noon-day from a desk, on each side
of which is a flaming taper.&nbsp; It is making them abandon
their ancient literature, their &lsquo;Mischna,&rsquo; their
&lsquo;Gemara,&rsquo; their &lsquo;Zohar,&rsquo; for gentility
novels, &lsquo;The Young Duke,&rsquo; the most unexceptionably
genteel book ever written, being the principal favourite.&nbsp;
It makes the young Jew ashamed of the young Jewess; it makes her
ashamed of the young Jew.&nbsp; The young Jew marries an opera
dancer, or if the dancer will not have him, as is frequently the
case, the cast-off Miss of the Honourable Spencer
So-and-so.&nbsp; It makes the young Jewess accept the honourable
offer of a cashiered lieutenant of the Bengal Native Infantry; or
if such a person does not come forward, the dishonourable offer
of a cornet of a regiment of crack hussars.&nbsp; It makes poor
Jews, male and female, forsake the synagogue for the sixpenny
theatre or penny hop; the Jew to take up with an Irish female of
loose character, and the Jewess with a musician of the Guards, or
the Tipperary servant of Captain Mulligan.&nbsp; With respect to
the gypsies, it is making the women what they never were
before&mdash;harlots; and the men what they never were
before&mdash;careless fathers and husbands.&nbsp; It has made the
daughter of Ursula the chaste take up with the base-drummer of a
wild-beast show.&nbsp; It makes Gorgiko Brown, <a
name="citation340"></a><a href="#footnote340"
class="citation">[340]</a> the gypsy man, leave his tent and his
old wife of an evening, and thrust himself into society which
could well dispense with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said
Mr. Petulengro the other day to the Romany Rye, after telling him
many things connected with the decadence of gypsyism,
&lsquo;there is one Gorgiko Brown, who, with a face as black as a
tea-kettle, wishes to be mistaken for a Christian tradesman; he
goes into the parlour of a third-rate inn of an evening, calls
for rum-and-water, and attempts to enter into conversation with
the company about politics and business.&nbsp; The company flout
him or give him the cold shoulder, or perhaps complain to the
landlord, who comes and asks him what business he has in the
parlour, telling him if he wants to drink to go into the
tap-room, and perhaps collars him and kicks him out, provided he
refuses to move.&rsquo;&nbsp; With respect to the Quakers, it
makes the young people, like the young Jews, crazy after
gentility diversions, worship, marriages, or connections, and
makes old Pease do what it makes Gorgiko Brown do&mdash;thrust
himself into society which could well dispense with him, and out
of which he is not kicked, because, unlike the gypsy, he is <!--

341</span>not poor.&nbsp; The writer would say much more on these
points, but want of room prevents him; he must therefore request
the reader to have patience until he can lay before the world a
pamphlet, which he has been long meditating, to be entitled
&lsquo;Remarks on the strikingly similar Effects which a Love for
Gentility has produced, and is producing, amongst Jews, Gypsies,
and Quakers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Priest in the book has much to say on the subject of this
gentility nonsense; no person can possibly despise it more
thoroughly than that very remarkable individual seems to do, yet
he hails its prevalence with pleasure, knowing the benefits which
will result from it to the church of which he is the sneering
slave.&nbsp; &lsquo;The English are mad after gentility,&rsquo;
says he; &lsquo;well, all the better for us.&nbsp; Their religion
for a long time past has been a plain and simple one, and
consequently by no means genteel; they&rsquo;ll quit it for ours,
which is the perfection of what they admire; with which Templars,
Hospitalers, mitred abbots, Gothic abbeys, long-drawn aisles,
golden censers, incense, et cetera, are connected; nothing, or
next to nothing, of Christ, it is true, but weighed in the
balance against gentility, where will Christianity be? why,
kicking against the beam&mdash;ho! ho!&rsquo;&nbsp; And in
connection with the gentility nonsense he expatiates largely, and
with much contempt, on a species of literature by which the
interests of his church in England have been very much
advanced&mdash;all genuine priests have a thorough contempt for
everything which tends to advance the interests of their
church&mdash;this literature is made up of pseudo-Jacobitism,
Charlie o&rsquo;er the waterism, or nonsense about Charlie
o&rsquo;er the water.&nbsp; And the writer will now take the
liberty of saying a few words about it on his own account.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>ON SCOTCH GENTILITY-NONSENSE&mdash;CHARLIE O&rsquo;ER THE
WATERISM</p>
<p>Of the literature just alluded to Scott was the
inventor.&nbsp; It is founded on the fortunes and misfortunes of
the Stuart family, of which Scott was the zealous defender and
apologist, doing all that in his power lay to represent the
members of it as noble, chivalrous, high-minded, unfortunate
princes; though, perhaps, of all the royal families that ever
existed upon earth, this family was the worst.&nbsp; It was
unfortunate enough, it is true; but it owed its misfortunes
entirely to its crimes, viciousness, bad faith, and
cowardice.&nbsp; Nothing will be said of it here until it made
its appearance in England to occupy the English throne.</p>
<p><!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>The first of the family which we have to do with,
James, was a dirty, cowardly miscreant, of whom the less said the
better.&nbsp; His son, Charles I., was a tyrant, exceedingly
cruel and revengeful, but weak and dastardly; he caused a poor
fellow to be hanged in London, who was not his subject, because
he had heard that the unfortunate creature had once bit his own
glove at Cadiz, in Spain, at the mention of his name; and he
permitted his own bull-dog, Strafford, to be executed by his own
enemies, though the only crime of Strafford was that he had
barked furiously at those enemies, and had worried two or three
of them when Charles shouted, &lsquo;Fetch
&rsquo;em!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was a bitter, but yet a despicable,
enemy, and the coldest and most worthless of friends; for though
he always hoped to be able some time or other to hang his
enemies, he was always ready to curry favour with them, more
especially if he could do so at the expense of his friends.&nbsp;
He was the haughtiest yet meanest of mankind.&nbsp; He once caned
a young nobleman for appearing before him in the drawing-room not
dressed exactly according to the court etiquette; yet he
condescended to flatter and compliment him who, from principle,
was his bitterest enemy&mdash;namely, Harrison, when the
Republican colonel was conducting him as a prisoner to
London.&nbsp; His bad faith was notorious; it was from abhorrence
of the first public instance which he gave of his bad
faith&mdash;his breaking his word to the Infanta of Spain, that
the poor Hiberno-Spainard bit his glove at Cadiz; and it was his
notorious bad faith which eventually cost him his head; for the
Republicans would gladly have spared him, provided they could
have put the slightest confidence in any promise, however solemn,
which he might have made to them.&nbsp; Of them it would be
difficult to say whether they most hated or despised him.&nbsp;
Religion he had none.&nbsp; One day he favoured Popery; the next,
on hearing certain clamours of the people, he sent his
wife&rsquo;s domestics back packing to France, because they were
Papists.&nbsp; Papists, however, should make him a saint, for he
was certainly the cause of the taking of Rochelle.</p>
<p>His son, Charles the Second, though he passed his youth in the
school of adversity, learned no other lesson from it than the
following one&mdash;take care of yourself, and never do an
action, either good or bad, which is likely to bring you into any
great difficulty; and this maxim he acted up to as soon as he
came to the throne.&nbsp; He was a Papist, but took especial care
not to acknowledge his religion, at which he frequently scoffed,
till just before his last gasp, when he knew that he could lose
nothing, and hoped to gain everything by it.&nbsp; He was always
in want of money, but took care not to tax the country beyond all
endurable bounds, preferring, to such a bold and dangerous
course, to become the secret pensioner of Louis, to whom, in
return for his <!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>gold, he sacrificed the honour and
interests of Britain.&nbsp; He was too lazy and sensual to
delight in playing the part of a tyrant himself; but he never
checked tyranny in others, save in one instance.&nbsp; He
permitted beastly butchers to commit unmentionable horrors on the
feeble, unarmed, and disunited Covenanters of Scotland, but
checked them when they would fain have endeavoured to play the
same game on the numerous, united, dogged, and warlike
Independents of England.&nbsp; To show his filial piety, he bade
the hangman dishonour the corpses of some of his father&rsquo;s
judges, before whom, when alive, he ran like a screaming hare;
but permitted those who had lost their all in supporting his
father&rsquo;s cause, to pine in misery and want.&nbsp; He would
give to a painted harlot a thousand pounds for a loathsome
embrace, and to a player or buffoon a hundred for a trumpery pun,
but would refuse a penny to the widow or orphan of an old
Royalist soldier.&nbsp; He was the personification of
selfishness; and as he loved and cared for no one, so did no one
love or care for him.&nbsp; So little had he gained the respect
or affection of those who surrounded him, that after his body had
undergone an after-death examination, parts of it were thrown
down the sinks of the palace, to become eventually the prey of
the swine and ducks of Westminster.</p>
<p>His brother, who succeeded him, James the Second, was a
Papist, but sufficiently honest to acknowledge his Popery, but,
upon the whole, he was a poor creature; though a tyrant, he was
cowardly; had he not been a coward he would never have lost his
throne.&nbsp; There were plenty of lovers of tyranny in England
who would have stood by him, provided he would have stood by
them, and would, though not Papists, have encouraged him in his
attempt to bring back England beneath the sway of Rome, and
perhaps would eventually have become Papists themselves; but the
nation raising a cry against him, and his son-in-law, the Prince
of Orange, invading the country, he forsook his friends&mdash;of
whom he had a host, but for whom he cared little&mdash;left his
throne, for which he cared a great deal, and Popery in England,
for which he cared yet more, to their fate, and escaped to
France, from whence, after taking a little heart, he repaired to
Ireland, where he was speedily joined by a gallant army of
Papists whom he basely abandoned at the Boyne, running away in a
most lamentable condition at the time when, by showing a little
courage, he might have enabled them to conquer.&nbsp; This
worthy, in his last will, bequeathed his heart to England, his
right arm to Scotland, and his bowels to Ireland.&nbsp; What the
English and Scotch said to their respective bequests is not
known, but it is certain that an old Irish priest, supposed to
have been a great-grand-uncle of the present Reverend Father
Murtagh, on hearing of the bequest to Ireland, fell into a great
passion, and, having been brought up at &lsquo;Paris and
Salamanca,&rsquo; expressed his indignation in the following
strain: &lsquo;Malditas sean <!-- page 344--><a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>tus tripas!
teniamos bastante del olor de tus tripas al tiempo de tu nuida
dela batalla del Boyne!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His son, generally called the Old Pretender, though born in
England, was carried in his infancy to France, where he was
brought up in the strictest principles of Popery, which
principles, however, did not prevent him becoming (when did they
ever prevent anyone?) a worthless and profligate scoundrel.&nbsp;
There are some doubts as to the reality of his being a son of
James, which doubts are probably unfounded, the grand proof of
his legitimacy being the thorough baseness of his
character.&nbsp; It was said of his father that he could speak
well, and it may be said of him that he could write
well&mdash;the only thing he could do which was worth doing,
always supposing that there is any merit in being able to
write.&nbsp; He was of a mean appearance, and, like his father,
pusillanimous to a degree.&nbsp; The meanness of his appearance
disgusted, and his pusillanimity discouraged the Scotch when he
made his appearance amongst them in the year 1715, some time
after the standard of rebellion had been hoisted by Mar.&nbsp; He
only stayed a short time in Scotland, and then, seized with
panic, retreated to France, leaving his friends to shift for
themselves as they best could.&nbsp; He died a pensioner of the
Pope.</p>
<p>The son of this man, Charles Edward, of whom so much in latter
years has been said and written, was a worthless, ignorant youth,
and a profligate and illiterate old man.&nbsp; When young, the
best that can be said of him is that he had occasionally springs
of courage, invariably at the wrong time and place, which merely
served to lead his friends into inextricable difficulties.&nbsp;
When old, he was loathsome and contemptible to both friend and
foe.&nbsp; His wife loathed him, and for the most terrible of
reasons; she did not pollute his couch, for to do that was
impossible&mdash;he had made it so vile; but she betrayed it,
inviting to it not only Alfieri the Filthy, but the coarsest
grooms.&nbsp; Doctor King, the warmest and almost last adherent
of his family, said that there was not a vice or crime of which
he was not guilty; as for his foes, they scorned to harm him even
when in their power.&nbsp; In the year 1745 he came down from the
Highlands of Scotland, which had long been a focus of
rebellion.&nbsp; He was attended by certain clans of the
Highlands&mdash;desperadoes used to freebootery from their
infancy, and consequently to the use of arms, and possessed of a
certain species of discipline.&nbsp; With these he defeated at
Prestonpans a body of men called soldiers, but who were in
reality peasants and artizans, levied about a month before,
without discipline or confidence in each other, and who were
miserably massacred by the Highland army.&nbsp; He subsequently
invaded England, nearly destitute of regular soldiers, and
penetrated as far as Derby, from which place he retreated on
learning that regular forces, which had been <!-- page 345--><a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>hastily
recalled from Flanders, were coming against him, with the Duke of
Cumberland at their head.&nbsp; He was pursued, and his
rear-guard overtaken and defeated by the dragoons of the Duke at
Clifton, from which place the rebels retreated in great confusion
across the Eden into Scotland, where they commenced dancing
Highland reels and strathspeys on the bank of the river for joy
at their escape, whilst a number of wretched girls, paramours of
some of them, were perishing in the waters of the swollen river
in an attempt to follow them.&nbsp; They themselves passed over
by eighties and by hundreds, arm-in-arm, for mutual safety,
without the loss of a man, but they left the poor paramours to
shift for themselves; nor did any of these canny people, after
passing the stream, dash back to rescue a single female
life&mdash;no, they were too well employed upon the bank in
dancing strathspeys to the tune of &lsquo;Charlie o&rsquo;er the
water.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was, indeed, Charlie o&rsquo;er the water,
and canny Highlanders o&rsquo;er the water, but where were the
poor prostitutes meantime?&nbsp; <i>In the water</i>.</p>
<p>The Jacobite farce, or tragedy, was speedily brought to a
close by the Battle of Culloden; there did Charlie wish himself
back again o&rsquo;er the water, exhibiting the most unmistakable
signs of pusillanimity; there were the clans cut to
pieces&mdash;at least, those who could be brought to the
charge&mdash;and there fell Giles Mac Bean, or, as he was called
in Gaelic, Giliosa Mac Beathan, a kind of giant, six feet four
inches and a quarter high, &lsquo;than whom,&rsquo; as his wife
said in a coronach she made upon him, &lsquo;no man who stood at
Cuiloitr was taller&rsquo;&mdash;Giles Mac Bean, the Major of the
clan Cattan, a great drinker, a great fisher, a great shooter,
and the champion of the Highland host.</p>
<p>The last of the Stuarts was a cardinal.</p>
<p>Such were the Stuarts, such their miserable history.&nbsp;
They were dead and buried, in every sense of the word, until
Scott resuscitated them&mdash;how?&mdash;by the power of fine
writing, and by calling to his aid that strange divinity,
gentility.&nbsp; He wrote splendid novels about the Stuarts, in
which he represents them as unlike what they really were, as the
graceful and beautiful papillon is unlike the hideous and filthy
worm.&nbsp; In a word, he made them genteel, and that was enough
to give them paramount sway over the minds of the British
people.&nbsp; The public became Stuart-mad, and everybody,
especially the women, said: &lsquo;What a pity it was that we
hadn&rsquo;t a Stuart to govern.&rsquo;&nbsp; All parties, Whig,
Tory, or Radical, became Jacobite at heart, and admirers of
absolute power.&nbsp; The Whigs talked about the liberty of the
subject, and the Radicals about the rights of man still; but
neither party cared a straw for what it talked about, and
mentally swore that, as soon as by means of such stuff they could
get places, and fill their pockets, they would be as Jacobite as
the Jacobs themselves.&nbsp; As for the Tories, no great <!--
page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>change in them was necessary; everything favouring
absolutism and slavery being congenial to them.&nbsp; So the
whole nation&mdash;that is, the reading part of the nation, with
some exceptions, for, thank God, there has always been some salt
in England&mdash;went over the water to Charlie.&nbsp; But going
over to Charlie was not enough; they must, or at least a
considerable part of them, go over to Rome, too, or have a
hankering to do so.&nbsp; As the Priest sarcastically observes in
the text, &lsquo;As all the Jacobs were Papists, so the good
folks who, through Scott&rsquo;s novels, admire the Jacobs must
be Papists too.&rsquo;&nbsp; An idea got about that the religion
of such genteel people as the Stuarts must be the climax of
gentility, and that idea was quite sufficient.&nbsp; Only let a
thing, whether temporal or spiritual, be considered genteel in
England, and if it be not followed it is strange indeed; so
Scott&rsquo;s writings not only made the greater part of the
nation Jacobite, but Popish.</p>
<p>Here some people will exclaim&mdash;whose opinions remain
sound and uncontaminated&mdash;what you say is perhaps true with
respect to the Jacobite nonsense at present so prevalent being
derived from Scott&rsquo;s novels, but the Popish nonsense, which
people of the genteeler class are so fond of, is derived from
Oxford.&nbsp; We sent our sons to Oxford nice honest lads,
educated in the principles of the Church of England, and at the
end of the first term they came home puppies, talking Popish
nonsense, which they had learned from the pedants to whose care
we had entrusted them; ay, not only Popery, but Jacobitism, which
they hardly carried with them from home, for we never heard them
talking Jacobitism before they had been at Oxford; but now their
conversation is a farrago of Popish and Jacobite stuff:
&lsquo;Complines and Claverse.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, what these
honest folks say is, to a certain extent, founded on fact; the
Popery which has overflowed the land during the last fourteen or
fifteen years has come immediately from Oxford, and likewise some
of the Jacobitism, Popish and Jacobite nonsense, and little or
nothing else, having been taught at Oxford for about that number
of years.&nbsp; But whence did the pedants get the Popish
nonsense with which they have corrupted youth?&nbsp; Why, from
the same quarter from which they got the Jacobite nonsense with
which they have inoculated those lads who were not inoculated
with it before&mdash;Scott&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Jacobitism and
Laudism, a kind of half Popery, had at one time been very
prevalent at Oxford, but both had been long consigned to oblivion
there, and people at Oxford cared as little about Laud as they
did about the Pretender.&nbsp; Both were dead and buried there,
as everywhere else, till Scott called them out of their graves,
when the pedants of Oxford hailed both; ay, and the Pope, too, as
soon as Scott had made the old fellow fascinating, through
particular novels, more especially the &lsquo;Monastery&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Abbot.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the quiet, respectable,
honourable Church of England would no longer do <!-- page
347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>for the pedants of Oxford; they must belong to a more
genteel Church&mdash;they were ashamed at first to be downright
Romans&mdash;so they would be Lauds.&nbsp; The pale-looking, but
exceedingly genteel, non-juring clergyman in Waverley was a Laud;
but they soon became tired of being Lauds, for Laud&rsquo;s
Church, gewgawish and idolatrous as it was, was not sufficiently
tinselly and idolatrous for them, so they must be Popes, but in a
sneaking way, still calling themselves Church of England men, in
order to batten on the bounty of the Church which they were
betraying, and likewise have opportunities of corrupting such
lads as might still resort to Oxford with principles
uncontaminated.</p>
<p>So the respectable people, whose opinions are still sound,
are, to a certain extent, right when they say that the tide of
Popery, which has flowed over the land, has come from
Oxford.&nbsp; It did come immediately from Oxford, but how did it
get to Oxford?&nbsp; Why, from Scott&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Oh!
that sermon which was the first manifestation of Oxford feeling,
preached at Oxford some time in the year &rsquo;38 by a divine of
a weak and confused intellect, in which Popery was mixed up with
Jacobitism!&nbsp; The present writer remembers perfectly well, on
reading some extracts from it at the time in a newspaper, on the
top of a coach, exclaiming: &lsquo;Why, the simpleton has been
pilfering from Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Oxford pedants!&nbsp; Oxford pedants! ye whose politics
and religion are both derived from Scott&rsquo;s novels! what a
pity it is that some lad of honest parents, whose mind ye are
endeavouring to stultify with your nonsense about
&lsquo;Complines and Claverse,&rsquo; has not the spirit to start
up and cry, &lsquo;Confound your gibberish!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
none of it.&nbsp; Hurrah for the Church, and the principles of my
<i>father</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED</h2>
<p>Now what could have induced Scott to write novels tending to
make people Papists and Jacobites, and in love with arbitrary
power?&nbsp; Did he think that Christianity was a gaudy
mummery?&nbsp; He did not, he could not, for he had read the
Bible; yet was he fond of gaudy mummeries, fond of talking about
them.&nbsp; Did he believe that the Stuarts were a good family,
and fit to govern a country like Britain?&nbsp; He knew that they
were a vicious, worthless crew, and that Britain was a degraded
country as long as they swayed the sceptre; but for those facts
he cared nothing, they governed in a way which he liked, for he
had an abstract love of despotism, and an abhorrence of
everything savouring of freedom and the rights of <!-- page
348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>man in general.&nbsp; His favourite political picture
was a joking, profligate, careless king, nominally absolute; the
heads of great houses paying court to, but in reality governing,
that king, whilst revelling with him on the plunder of a nation,
and a set of crouching, grovelling vassals (the literal meaning
of vassal is a wretch), who, after allowing themselves to be
horsewhipped, would take a bone if flung to them, and be
grateful; so that in love with mummery, though he knew what
Christianity was, no wonder he admired such a Church as that of
Rome, and that which Laud set up; and by nature formed to be the
holder of the candle to ancient worm-eaten and profligate
families, no wonder that all his sympathies were with the Stuarts
and their dissipated, insolent party, and all his hatred directed
against those who endeavoured to check them in their proceedings,
and to raise the generality of mankind something above a state of
vassalage that is wretchedness.&nbsp; Those who were born great,
were, if he could have had his will, always to remain great,
however worthless their characters.&nbsp; Those who were born
low, were always to remain so, however great their talents;
though if that rule were carried out, where would he have been
himself?</p>
<p>In the book which he called the &lsquo;History of Napoleon
Bonaparte,&rsquo; in which he plays the sycophant to all the
legitimate crowned heads in Europe, whatever their crimes, vices,
or miserable imbecilities, he, in his abhorrence of everything
low which by its own vigour makes itself illustrious, calls Murat
of the sabre the son of a pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise
pastry-cook.&nbsp; It is a pity that people who give themselves
hoity-toity airs&mdash;and the Scotch in general are wonderfully
addicted to giving themselves hoity-toity airs, and checking
people better than themselves with their birth <a
name="citation348"></a><a href="#footnote348"
class="citation">[348]</a> and their country&mdash;it is a great
pity that such people do not look at home&mdash;son of a
pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise pastry-cook!&nbsp; Well, and what
was Scott himself?&nbsp; Why, son of a pettifogger, of an
Edinburgh pettifogger.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, but Scott was descended
from the old cow-stealers of Buccleuch, and
therefore&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Descended from old cow-stealers,
was he?&nbsp; Well, had he had nothing to boast of beyond such a
pedigree, he would have lived and died the son of a pettifogger
and been forgotten, and deservedly so; but he possessed talents,
and by his talents rose like Murat, and like him will be
remembered for <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>his talents alone, and deservedly
so.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, but Murat was still the son of a
pastry-cook, and though he was certainly good at the sabre, and
cut his way to a throne, still&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Lord! what
fools there are in the world; but as no one can be thought
anything of in this world without a pedigree, the writer will now
give a pedigree for Murat, of a very different character from the
cow-stealing one of Scott, but such a one as the proudest he
might not disdain to claim.&nbsp; Scott was descended from the
old cow-stealers of Buccleuch&mdash;was he?&nbsp; Good! and Murat
was descended from the old Moors of Spain, from the Abencerages
(sons of the saddle) of Granada.&nbsp; The name Murat is Arabic,
and is the same as Murad (Le Desir&eacute;, or the wished-for
one).&nbsp; Scott, in his genteel life of Bonaparte, says that
&lsquo;when Murat was in Egypt the similarity between the name of
the celebrated Mameluke Mourad and that of Bonaparte&rsquo;s
Meilleur Sabreur was remarked, and became the subject of jest
amongst the comrades of the gallant Frenchman.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
the writer of the novel of Bonaparte did not know that the names
were one and the same.&nbsp; Now, which was the best pedigree,
that of the son of the pastry-cook, or that of the son of the
pettifogger?&nbsp; Which was the best blood?&nbsp; Let us observe
the workings of the two bloods.&nbsp; He who had the blood of the
&lsquo;sons of the saddle&rsquo; in him became the wonderful
cavalier of the most wonderful host that ever went forth to
conquest, won for himself a crown, and died the death of a
soldier, leaving behind him a son, only inferior to himself in
strength, in prowess, and in horsemanship.&nbsp; The descendant
of the cow-stealer became a poet, a novel writer, the panegyrist
of great folks and genteel people; became insolvent because,
though an author, he deemed it ungenteel to be mixed up with the
business part of authorship; died paralytic and broken-hearted
because he could no longer give entertainments to great folks;
leaving behind him, amongst other children, who were never heard
of, a son, who, through his father&rsquo;s interest, had become
lieutenant-colonel in a genteel cavalry regiment.&nbsp; A son who
was ashamed of his father because his father was an
author&mdash;a son who&mdash;paugh!&mdash;why ask which was the
best blood?</p>
<p>So, owing to his rage for gentility, Scott must needs become
the apologist of the Stuarts and their party; but God made this
man pay dearly for taking the part of the wicked against the
good; for lauding up to the skies miscreants and robbers, and
calumniating the noble spirits of Britain, the salt of England,
and his own country.&nbsp; As God had driven the Stuarts from
their throne, and their followers from their estates, making them
vagabonds and beggars on the face of the earth, taking from them
all they cared for, so did that same God, who knows perfectly
well how and where to strike, deprive the apologist of that
wretched crew of all that rendered life pleasant in his eyes,
<!-- page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span>the lack of which paralyzed him in body and mind,
rendered him pitiable to others, loathsome to himself&mdash;so
much so that he once said, &lsquo;Where is the beggar who would
change place with me, notwithstanding all my fame?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Ah! God knows perfectly well how to strike.&nbsp; He permitted
him to retain all his literary fame to the very last&mdash;his
literary fame for which he cared nothing; but what became of the
sweetnesses of life, his fine house, his grand company, and his
entertainments?&nbsp; The grand house ceased to be his; he was
only permitted to live in it on sufferance, and whatever grandeur
it might still retain to soon became as desolate a looking house
as any misanthrope could wish to see.&nbsp; Where were the grand
entertainments and the grand company?&nbsp; There are no grand
entertainments where there is no money; no lords and ladies where
there are no entertainments&mdash;and there lay the poor lodger
in the desolate house, groaning on a bed no longer his, smitten
by the hand of God in the part where he was most
vulnerable.&nbsp; Of what use telling such a man to take comfort,
for he had written the &lsquo;Minstrel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rob
Roy&rsquo;&mdash;telling him to think of his literary fame?&nbsp;
Literary fame, indeed! he wanted back his lost gentility:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Retain my altar,<br />
I care nothing for it&mdash;but oh! touch not my
<i>beard</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Porny&rsquo;s</span> <i>War of the Gods</i>.</p>
<p>He dies, his children die too, and then comes the crowning
judgment of God on what remained of his race, and the house which
he had built.&nbsp; He was not a Papist himself, nor did he wish
anyone belonging to him to be Popish, for he had read enough of
the Bible to know that no one can be saved through Popery, yet
had he a sneaking affection for it, and would at all times, in an
underhand manner, give it a good word both in writing and
discourse, because it was a gaudy kind of worship, and ignorance
and vassalage prevailed so long as it flourished; but he
certainly did not wish any of his people to become Papists, nor
the house which he had built to become a Popish house, though the
very name he gave it savoured of Popery.&nbsp; But Popery becomes
fashionable through his novels and poems&mdash;the only one that
remains of his race, a female grandchild, marries a person who,
following the fashion, becomes a Papist, and makes her a Papist
too.&nbsp; Money abounds with the husband who buys the house, and
then the house becomes the rankest Popish house in Britain.&nbsp;
A superstitious person might almost imagine that one of the old
Scottish Covenanters, whilst the grand house was being built from
the profits resulting from the sale of writings favouring Popery
and persecution, and calumniatory of Scotland&rsquo;s saints and
martyrs, had risen from the grave, and banned Scott, his race,
and his house, by reading a certain psalm.</p>
<p>In saying what he has said about Scott the author has not <!--
page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>been influenced by any feeling of malice or ill-will,
but simply by a regard for truth, and a desire to point out to
his countrymen the harm which has resulted from the perusal of
his works; he is not one of those who would depreciate the
talents of Scott, he admires his talents, both as a prose writer
and a poet.&nbsp; As a poet especially he admires him, and
believes him to have been by far the greatest, with perhaps the
exception of Mickiewicz, who only wrote for unfortunate Poland,
that Europe has given birth to during the last hundred
years.&nbsp; As a prose writer he admires him less, it is true,
but his admiration for him in that capacity is very high, and he
only laments that he prostituted his talents to the cause of the
Stuarts and gentility.&nbsp; What book of fiction of the present
century can you read twice, with the exception of
&lsquo;Waverley&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rob Roy?&rsquo;&nbsp; There is
&lsquo;Pelham,&rsquo; it is true, which the writer of these lines
has seen a Jewess reading in the steppe of Debreczin, and which a
young Prussian Baron, a great traveller, whom he met at
Constantinople in &rsquo;44, told him he always carried in his
valise.&nbsp; And in conclusion he will say, in order to show the
opinion which he entertains of the power of Scott as a writer,
that he did for the spectre of the wretched Pretender what all
the kings of Europe could not do for his body&mdash;placed it on
the throne of these realms, and for Popery what Popes and
Cardinals strove in vain to do for three centuries&mdash;brought
back its mummeries and nonsense into the temples of the British
Isles.</p>
<p>Scott during his lifetime had a crowd of imitators, who,
whether they wrote history so called, poetry so called, or
novels&mdash;nobody would call a book a novel if he could call it
anything else&mdash;wrote Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense,
and now that he has been dead a quarter of a century, there are
others daily springing up who are striving to imitate Scott in
his Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense&mdash;for nonsense it
is, even when flowing from his pen.&nbsp; They, too, must write
Jacobite histories, Jacobite songs, and Jacobite novels, and much
the same figure as the scoundrel menials in the comedy cut when
personating their masters, and retailing their masters&rsquo;
conversation do they cut as Walter Scotts.&nbsp; In their
histories, they too talk about the Prince and Glenfinnan, and the
pibroch; and in their songs about &lsquo;Claverse&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Bonny Dundee.&rsquo;&nbsp; But though they may be Scots,
they are not Walter Scotts.&nbsp; But it is perhaps chiefly in
the novel that you see the veritable hog in armour; the time of
the novel is of course the &rsquo;15 or &rsquo;45; the hero a
Jacobite, and connected with one or other of the enterprises of
those periods; and the author, to show how unprejudiced he is,
and what <i>original</i> views he takes of subjects, must needs
speak up for Popery, whenever he has occasion to mention it;
though, with all his originality, when he brings his hero and the
vagabonds with which he is concerned before a barricadoed house,
belonging <!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>to the Whigs, he can make them get
into it by no other method than that which Scott makes his
rioters employ to get into the Tolbooth, <i>burning down</i> the
door.</p>
<p>To express the more than utter foolishness of this latter
Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense, whether in rhyme or prose,
there is but one word, and that word a Scotch word.&nbsp; Scotch,
the sorriest of jargons, compared with which even Roth Welsch is
dignified and expressive, has yet one word to express what would
be inexpressible by any word or combination of words in any
language, or in any other jargon in the world; and very properly;
for as the nonsense is properly Scotch, so should the word be
Scotch which expresses it; that word is
&lsquo;fushionless,&rsquo; pronounced <i>fooshionless</i>; and
when the writer has called the nonsense fooshionless&mdash;and he
does call it fooshionless&mdash;he has nothing more to say, but
leaves the nonsense to its fate.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;ON CANTING NONSENSE</h2>
<p>The writer now wishes to say something on the subject of
canting nonsense, of which there is a great deal in
England.&nbsp; There are various cants in England, amongst which
is the religious cant.&nbsp; He is not going to discuss the
subject of religious cant; lest, however, he should be
misunderstood, he begs leave to repeat that he is a sincere
member of the old-fashioned Church of England, in which he
believes there is more religion, and consequently less cant, than
in any other church in the world; nor is he going to discuss many
other cants; he shall content himself with saying something about
two&mdash;the temperance cant and the unmanly cant.&nbsp;
Temperance canters say that &lsquo;it is unlawful to drink a
glass of ale.&rsquo;&nbsp; Unmanly canters say that &lsquo;it is
unlawful to use one&rsquo;s fists.&rsquo;&nbsp; The writer begs
leave to tell both these species of canters that they do not
speak the words of truth.</p>
<p>It is very lawful to take a cup of ale, or wine, for the
purpose of cheering or invigorating yourself when you are faint
and down-hearted; and likewise to give a cup of ale or wine to
others when they are in a similar condition.&nbsp; The Holy
Scripture sayeth nothing to the contrary, but rather encourageth
people in so doing by the text, &lsquo;Wine maketh glad the heart
of man.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it is not lawful to intoxicate yourself
with frequent cups of ale or wine, nor to make others
intoxicated, nor does the Holy Scripture say that it is.&nbsp;
The Holy Scripture no more says that it is lawful to intoxicate
yourself or others, than it says that it is unlawful to take a
cup of ale or wine yourself, or to give one to others.&nbsp; Noah
is not commended in the Scripture for making <!-- page 353--><a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>himself
drunken on the wine he brewed.&nbsp; Nor is it said that the
Saviour, when He supplied the guests with first-rate wine at the
marriage feast, told them to make themselves drunk upon it.&nbsp;
He is said to have supplied them with first-rate wine, but He
doubtless left the quantity which each should drink to each
party&rsquo;s reason and discretion.&nbsp; When you set a good
dinner before your guests, you do not expect that they should
gorge themselves with the victuals you set before them.&nbsp;
Wine may be abused, and so may a leg of mutton.</p>
<p>Second.&nbsp; It is lawful for anyone to use his fists in his
own defence, or in the defence of others, provided they
can&rsquo;t help themselves; but it is not lawful to use them for
purposes of tyranny or brutality.&nbsp; If you are attacked by a
ruffian, as the elderly individual in &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is
in the inn-yard, it is quite lawful, if you can, to give him as
good a thrashing as the elderly individual gave the brutal
coachman; and if you see a helpless woman&mdash;perhaps your own
sister&mdash;set upon by a drunken lord, a drunken coachman, or a
drunken coalheaver, or a brute of any description, either drunk
or sober, it is not only lawful, but laudable, to give them, if
you can, a good drubbing; but it is not lawful, because you have
a strong pair of fists, and know how to use them, to go
swaggering through a fair, jostling against unoffending
individuals; should you do so, you would be served quite right if
you were to get a drubbing, more particularly if you were served
out by some one less strong, but more skilful than
yourself&mdash;even as the coachman was served out by a pupil of
the immortal Broughton&mdash;sixty years old, it is true, but
possessed of Broughton&rsquo;s guard and chop.&nbsp; Moses is not
blamed in the Scripture for taking part with the oppressed, and
killing an Egyptian persecutor.&nbsp; We are not told how Moses
killed the Egyptian; but it is quite as creditable to Moses to
suppose that he killed the Egyptian by giving him a buffet under
the left ear, as by stabbing him with a knife.&nbsp; It is true,
that the Saviour in the New Testament tells His disciples to turn
the left cheek to be smitten, after they had received a blow on
the right; but He was speaking to people divinely inspired, or
whom He intended divinely to inspire&mdash;people selected by God
for a particular purpose.&nbsp; He likewise tells these people to
part with various articles of raiment when asked for them, and to
go a-travelling without money, and to take no thought of the
morrow.&nbsp; Are those exhortations carried out by very good
people in the present day?&nbsp; Do Quakers, when smitten on the
right cheek, turn the left to the smiter?&nbsp; When asked for
their coat, do they say: &lsquo;Friend, take my shirt
also&rsquo;?&nbsp; Has the Dean of Salisbury no purse?&nbsp; Does
the Archbishop of Canterbury go to an inn, run up a reckoning,
and then say to his landlady, &lsquo;Mistress, I have no
coin&rsquo;?&nbsp; Assuredly the Dean has a purse, and a
tolerably well-filled one; and, assuredly, the <!-- page 354--><a
name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>Archbishop,
on departing from an inn, not only settles his reckoning, but
leaves something handsome for the servants, and does not say that
he is forbidden by the Gospel to pay for what he has eaten, or
the trouble he has given, as a certain Spanish cavalier said he
was forbidden by the statutes of chivalry.&nbsp; Now, to take the
part of yourself, or the part of the oppressed, with your fists,
is quite as lawful in the present day as it is to refuse your
coat and your shirt also to any vagabond who may ask for them,
and not to refuse to pay for supper, bed, and breakfast, at the
Feathers, or any other inn, after you have had the benefit of all
three.</p>
<p>The conduct of Lavengro with respect to drink may, upon the
whole, serve as a model.&nbsp; He is no drunkard, nor is he fond
of intoxicating other people; yet when the horrors are upon him
he has no objection to go to a public-house and call for a pint
of ale, nor does he shrink from recommending ale to others when
they are faint and downcast.&nbsp; In one instance, it is true,
he does what cannot be exactly justified; he encourages the
Priest in the dingle, in more instances than one, in drinking
more hollands and water than is consistent with decorum.&nbsp; He
has a motive indeed in doing so; a desire to learn from the knave
in his cups the plans and hopes of the Propaganda of Rome.&nbsp;
Such conduct, however, was inconsistent with strict fair dealing
and openness; and the author advises all those whose consciences
never reproach them for a single unfair or covert act committed
by them, to abuse him heartily for administering hollands and
water to the Priest of Rome.&nbsp; In that instance the hero is
certainly wrong; yet in all other cases with regard to drink, he
is manifestly right.&nbsp; To tell people that they are never to
drink a glass of ale or wine themselves, or to give one to
others, is cant; and the writer has no toleration for cant of any
description.&nbsp; Some cants are not dangerous; but the writer
believes that a more dangerous cant than the temperance cant, or,
as it is generally called, teetotalism, is scarcely to be
found.&nbsp; The writer is willing to believe that it originated
with well-meaning, though weak people; but there can be no doubt
that it was quickly turned to account by people who were neither
well-meaning nor weak.&nbsp; Let the reader note particularly the
purpose to which this cry has been turned in America; the land,
indeed, par excellence, of humbug and humbug cries.&nbsp; It is
there continually in the mouth of the most violent political
party, and is made an instrument of almost unexampled
persecution.&nbsp; The writer would say more on the temperance
cant, both in England and America, but want of space prevents
him.&nbsp; There is one point on which he cannot avoid making a
few brief remarks&mdash;that is, the inconsistent conduct of its
apostles in general.&nbsp; The teetotal apostle says it is a
dreadful thing to be drunk.&nbsp; So it is, teetotaller; but, if
so, why do you get drunk?&nbsp; I get drunk?&nbsp; <!-- page
355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>Yes, unhappy man, why do you get drunk on smoke and
passion?&nbsp; Why are your garments impregnated with the odour
of the Indian weed?&nbsp; Why is there a pipe or cigar always in
your mouth?&nbsp; Why is your language more dreadful than that of
a Poissarde?&nbsp; Tobacco smoke is more deleterious than ale,
teetotaller; bile more potent than brandy.&nbsp; You are fond of
telling your hearers what an awful thing it is to die
drunken.&nbsp; So it is teetotaller.&nbsp; Then take care that
you do not die with smoke and passion, drunken, and with
temperance language on your lips; that is, abuse and calumny
against all those who differ from you.&nbsp; One word of sense
you have been heard to say, which is, that spirits may be taken
as a medicine.&nbsp; Now you are in a fever of passion,
teetotaller; so, pray take this tumbler of brandy; take it on the
hom&oelig;opathic principle, that heat is to be expelled by
heat.&nbsp; You are in a temperance fury, so swallow the contents
of this tumbler, and it will, perhaps, cure you.&nbsp; You look
at the glass wistfully&mdash;you say you occasionally take a
glass medicinally, and it is probable you do.&nbsp; Take one
now.&nbsp; Consider what a dreadful thing it would be to die
passion drunk, to appear before your Maker with
<i>in</i>temperate language on your lips.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right!&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t seem to wince at the brandy.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s right&mdash;well done!&nbsp; All down in two
pulls.&nbsp; Now you look like a reasonable being!</p>
<p>If the conduct of Lavengro with regard to drink is open to
little censure, assuredly the use which he makes of his fists is
entitled to none at all.&nbsp; Because he has a pair of tolerably
strong fists, and knows to a certain extent how to use them, is
he a swaggerer or oppressor?&nbsp; To what ill account does he
turn them?&nbsp; Who more quiet, gentle, and inoffensive than
he?&nbsp; He beats off a ruffian who attacks him in a dingle; has
a kind of friendly tuzzle with Mr. Petulengro, and behold the
extent of his fistic exploits.</p>
<p>Ay, but he associates with prize-fighters; and that very
fellow, Petulengro, is a prize-fighter, and has fought for a
stake in a ring.&nbsp; Well, and if he had not associated with
prize-fighters, how could he have used his fists?&nbsp; Oh,
anybody can use his fists in his own defence, without being
taught by prize-fighters.&nbsp; Can they?&nbsp; Then why does not
the Italian, or Spaniard, or Affghan use his fists when insulted
or outraged, instead of having recourse to the weapons which he
has recourse to?&nbsp; Nobody can use his fists without being
taught the use of them by those who have themselves been taught,
no more than anyone can &lsquo;whiffle&rsquo; <a
name="citation355"></a><a href="#footnote355"
class="citation">[355]</a> without being taught by a master of
the art.&nbsp; Now let any man of the present day try to
whiffle.&nbsp; Would not anyone who wished to whiffle have to go
to a master of the art?&nbsp; Assuredly! but where would he find
one at the present day?&nbsp; The last of the whifflers hanged
himself about a fortnight ago on a bell-rope in a church <!--
page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>steeple of &lsquo;the old town,&rsquo; from pure grief
that there was no further demand for the exhibition of his art,
there being no demand for whiffling since the discontinuation of
Guildhall banquets.&nbsp; Whiffling is lost.&nbsp; The old chap
left his sword behind him; let anyone take up the old
chap&rsquo;s sword and try to whiffle.&nbsp; Now much the same
hand as he would make who should take up the whiffler&rsquo;s
sword and try to whiffle, would he who should try to use his
fists who had never had the advantage of a master.&nbsp; Let no
one think that men use their fists naturally in their own
disputes&mdash;men have naturally recourse to any other thing to
defend themselves or to offend others; they fly to the stick, to
the stone, to the murderous and cowardly knife, or to abuse as
cowardly as the knife, and occasionally more murderous.&nbsp; Now
which is best when you hate a person, or have a pique against a
person, to clench your fist and say &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; or to
have recourse to the stone, the knife, or murderous
calumny?&nbsp; The use of the fist is almost lost in
England.&nbsp; Yet are the people better than they were when they
knew how to use their fists?&nbsp; The writer believes not.&nbsp;
A fisty combat is at present a great rarity, but the use of the
knife, the noose, and of poison, to say nothing of calumny, are
of more frequent occurrence in England than perhaps in any
country in Europe.&nbsp; Is polite taste better than when it
could bear the details of a fight!&nbsp; The writer believes
not.&nbsp; Two men cannot meet in a ring to settle a dispute in a
manly manner without some trumpery local newspaper letting loose
a volley of abuse against &lsquo;the disgraceful
exhibition,&rsquo; in which abuse it is sure to be sanctioned by
its dainty readers; whereas some murderous horror, the discovery,
for example, of the mangled remains of a woman in some obscure
den, is greedily seized hold on by the moral journal and dressed
up for its readers, who luxuriate and gloat upon the ghastly
dish.&nbsp; Now, the writer of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; has no
sympathy with those who would shrink from striking a blow, but
would not shrink from the use of poison or calumny; and his taste
has little in common with that which cannot tolerate the hardy
details of a prize-fight, but which luxuriates on descriptions of
the murder dens of modern England.&nbsp; But prize-fighters and
pugilists are blackguards, a reviewer has said; and blackguards
they would be, provided they employed their skill and their
prowess for purposes of brutality and oppression; but
prize-fighters and pugilists are seldom friends to brutality and
oppression; and which is the blackguard, the writer would ask, he
who uses his fists to take his own part, or instructs others to
use theirs for the same purpose, or the being who from envy and
malice, or at the bidding of a malicious scoundrel, endeavours by
calumny, falsehood, and misrepresentation to impede the efforts
of lonely and unprotected genius?</p>
<p>One word more about the race, all but extinct, of the people
opprobriously called prize-fighters.&nbsp; Some of them have been
<!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>as noble, kindly men as the world ever produced.&nbsp;
Can the rolls of the English aristocracy exhibit names belonging
to more noble, heroic men, than those who were called
respectively Pearce, Cribb, <a name="citation357a"></a><a
href="#footnote357a" class="citation">[357a]</a> and Spring? <a
name="citation357b"></a><a href="#footnote357b"
class="citation">[357b]</a>&nbsp; Did ever one of the English
aristocracy contract the seeds of fatal consumption by rushing up
the stairs of a burning edifice, even to the topmost garret, and
rescuing a woman from seemingly inevitable destruction?&nbsp; The
writer says, No.&nbsp; A woman was rescued from the top of a
burning house, but the man who rescued her was no aristocrat; it
was Pearce, not Percy, who ran up the burning stairs.&nbsp; Did
ever one of those glittering ones save a fainting female from the
libidinous rage of six ruffians?&nbsp; The writer believes
not.&nbsp; A woman was rescued from the libidinous fury of six
monsters on --- Down, but the man who rescued her was no
aristocrat; it was Pearce, not Paulet, who rescued the woman, and
thrashed my lord&rsquo;s six gamekeepers&mdash;Pearce, whose
equal never was, and probably never will be, found in sturdy
combat.&nbsp; Are there any of the aristocracy of whom it can be
said that they never did a cowardly, cruel, or mean action, and
that they invariably took the part of the unfortunate and weak
against cruelty and oppression?&nbsp; As much can be said of
Cribb, of Spring, and the other; but where is the aristocrat of
whom as much can be said?&nbsp; Wellington?&nbsp; Wellington,
indeed!&nbsp; A skilful general, and a good man of valour, it is
true, but with that cant word of &lsquo;duty&rsquo; continually
on his lips, did he rescue Ney from his butchers?&nbsp; Did he
lend a helping hand to Warner?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the writer would strongly advise those of his
country-folks who may read his book to have nothing to do with
the two kinds of canting nonsense described above, but in their
progress through life to enjoy as well as they can, but always
with moderation, the good things of this world, to put confidence
in God, to be as independent as possible, and to take their own
parts.&nbsp; If they are low-spirited, let them not make
themselves foolish by putting on sackcloth, drinking water, or
chewing ashes, but let them take wholesome exercise, and eat the
most generous food they can get, taking up and reading
occasionally, not the lives of Ignatius Loyola and Francis Spira,
but something more agreeable; for example, the life and
adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell, the deaf and dumb gentleman;
the travels of Captain Falconer in America, and the journal of
John Randall, who went to Virginia and married an Indian wife;
not forgetting, amidst their eating and drinking, their walks
over heaths, and by the sea-side, and their agreeable literature,
to be charitable to the poor, to read the Psalms, and to go to
church twice on a Sunday.&nbsp; In their dealings with people to
be courteous to everybody, as Lavengro was, but always
independent like <!-- page 358--><a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>him; and if people meddle with them,
to give them as good as they bring, even as he and Isopel Berners
were in the habit of doing; and it will be as well for him to
observe that he by no means advises women to be too womanly, but
bearing the conduct of Isopel Berners in mind, to take their own
parts, and if anybody strikes them, to strike again.</p>
<p>Beating of women by the lords of the creation has become very
prevalent in England since pugilism has been
discountenanced.&nbsp; Now the writer strongly advises any woman
who is struck by a ruffian to strike him again; or if she cannot
clench her fists, and he advises all women in these singular
times to learn to clench their fists, to go at him with tooth and
nail, and not to be afraid of the result, for any fellow who is
dastard enough to strike a woman, would allow himself to be
beaten by a woman, were she to make at him in self-defence, even
if, instead of possessing the stately height and athletic
proportions of the aforesaid Isopel, she were as diminutive in
stature, and had a hand as delicate and a foot as small as a
certain royal lady, who was some time ago assaulted by a fellow
upwards of six feet high, whom the writer has no doubt she could
have beaten had she thought proper to go at him.&nbsp; Such is
the deliberate advice of the author to his countrymen and
women&mdash;advice in which he believes there is nothing
unscriptural or repugnant to common-sense.</p>
<p>The writer is perfectly well aware that, by the plain language
which he has used in speaking of the various kinds of nonsense
prevalent in England, he shall make himself a multitude of
enemies; but he is not going to conceal the truth, or to tamper
with nonsense, from the fear of provoking hostility.&nbsp; He has
a duty to perform, and he will perform it resolutely; he is the
person who carried the Bible to Spain; and as resolutely as he
spoke in Spain against the superstitions of Spain, will he speak
in England against the nonsense of his own native land.&nbsp; He
is not one of those who, before they sit down to write a book,
say to themselves, What cry shall we take up? what principles
shall we advocate?&nbsp; What principles shall we abuse?&nbsp;
Before we put pen to paper we must find out what cry is the
loudest, what principle has the most advocates, otherwise, after
having written our book, we may find ourselves on the weaker
side.</p>
<p>A sailor of the <i>Bounty</i>, waked from his sleep by the
noise of the mutiny, lay still in his hammock for some time,
quite undecided whether to take part with the captain or to join
the mutineers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must mind what I do,&rsquo; said he
to himself, &lsquo;lest in the end I find myself on the weaker
side.&rsquo;&nbsp; Finally, on hearing that the mutineers were
successful, he went on deck, and seeing Bligh pinioned to the
mast, he put his fist to his nose, and otherwise insulted
him.&nbsp; Now, there are many writers of the present day whose
conduct is very similar to that of the sailor.&nbsp; They lie
listening in their corners till they have ascertained which <!--
page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>principle has most advocates; then presently they make
their appearance on the deck of the world with their book; if
truth has been victorious, then has truth their hurrah! but if
truth is pinioned against the mast, then is their fist thrust
against the nose of truth, and their gibe and their insult
spirted in her face.&nbsp; The strongest party had the sailor,
and the strongest party has almost invariably the writer of the
present day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;PSEUDO-CRITICS</h2>
<p>A certain set of individuals calling themselves critics have
attacked &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; with much virulence and
malice.&nbsp; If what they call criticism had been founded on
truth, the author would have had nothing to say.&nbsp; The book
contains plenty of blemishes, some of them, by-the-by, wilful
ones, as the writer will presently show; not one of these,
however, has been detected and pointed out; but the best passages
in the book, indeed, whatever was calculated to make the book
valuable, have been assailed with abuse and
misrepresentation.&nbsp; The duty of the true critic is to play
the part of a leech, and not of a viper.&nbsp; Upon true and upon
malignant criticism there is an excellent fable by the Spaniard
Iriarte.&nbsp; The viper says to the leech, &lsquo;Why do people
invite your bite, and flee from mine?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; says the leech, &lsquo;people receive
health from my bite, and poison from yours.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is as much difference,&rsquo; says the clever
Spaniard, &lsquo;between true and malignant criticism as between
poison and medicine.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly a great many
meritorious writers have allowed themselves to be poisoned by
malignant criticism; the writer, however, is not one of those who
allow themselves to be poisoned by pseudo-critics; no! no! he
will rather hold them up by their tails, and show the creatures
wriggling, blood and foam streaming from their broken jaws.&nbsp;
First of all, however, he will notice one of their
objections.&nbsp; &lsquo;The book isn&rsquo;t true,&rsquo; say
they.&nbsp; Now one of the principal reasons with those that have
attacked &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; for their abuse of it is, that it
is particularly true in one instance, namely, that it exposes
their own nonsense, their love of humbug, their slavishness,
their dressings, their goings out, their scraping and bowing to
great people; it is the showing up of &lsquo;gentility
nonsense&rsquo; in &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; that has been one
principal reason for the raising of the above cry; for in
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is denounced the besetting folly of the
English people, a folly which those who call themselves guardians
of the public taste are far from being above.&nbsp; &lsquo;We
can&rsquo;t abide anything that isn&rsquo;t true!&rsquo; they
exclaim.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; Then why are they so
enraptured <!-- page 360--><a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>with any fiction that is adapted to
purposes of humbug, which tends to make them satisfied with their
own proceedings, with their own nonsense, which does not tell
them to reform, to become more alive to their own failings, and
less sensitive about the tyrannical goings on of the masters, and
the degraded condition, the sufferings, and the trials of the
serfs, in the star Jupiter?&nbsp; Had &lsquo;Lavengro,&rsquo;
instead of being the work of an independent mind, been written in
order to further any of the thousand and one cants, and species
of nonsense prevalent in England, the author would have heard
much less about its not being true, both from public detractors
and private censurers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But &ldquo;Lavengro&rdquo; pretends to be an
autobiography,&rsquo; <a name="citation360"></a><a
href="#footnote360" class="citation">[360]</a> say the critics;
and here the writer begs leave to observe, that it would be well
for people who profess to have a regard for truth, not to exhibit
in every assertion which they make a most profligate disregard of
it; this assertion of theirs is a falsehood, and they know it to
be a falsehood.&nbsp; In the preface &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is
stated to be a dream; and the writer takes this opportunity of
stating that he never said it was an autobiography, never
authorized any person to say that it was one; and that he has in
innumerable instances declared in public and private, both before
and after the work was published, that it was not what is
generally termed an autobiography; but a set of people who
pretend to write criticisms on books, hating the author for
various reasons&mdash;amongst others, because, having the proper
pride of a gentleman and a scholar, he did not, in the year 1843,
choose to permit himself to be exhibited and made a zany of in
London, and especially because he will neither associate with,
nor curry favour with, them who are neither gentlemen nor
scholars&mdash;attack his book with abuse and calumny.&nbsp; He
is, perhaps, condescending too much when he takes any notice of
such people; as, however, the English public is wonderfully led
by cries and shouts, and generally ready to take part against any
person who is either unwilling or unable to defend himself, he
deems it advisable not to be altogether quiet with those who
assail him.&nbsp; The best way to deal with vipers is to tear out
their teeth; and the best way to deal with pseudo-critics is to
deprive them of their poison-bag, which is easily done by
exposing their ignorance.&nbsp; The writer knew perfectly well
the description of people with whom he would have to do, he
therefore very quietly prepared a stratagem, by means of which he
could at any time exhibit them, powerless and helpless in his
hand.&nbsp; Critics, when they review books, ought to have a
competent knowledge of the subjects which those books
discuss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; is a philological book, a poem if you
chose to call it so.&nbsp; Now, what a fine triumph it would have
been for those who wished to vilify the book and its author,
provided they could <!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>have detected the latter tripping in
his philology&mdash;they might have instantly said that he was an
ignorant pretender to philology&mdash;they laughed at the idea of
his taking up a viper up by its tail, a trick which hundreds of
country urchins do every September, but they were silent about
the really wonderful part of the book, the philological
matter&mdash;they thought philology was his stronghold, and that
it would be useless to attack him there; they of course would
give him no credit as a philologist, for anything like fair
treatment towards him was not to be expected at their hands, but
they were afraid to attack his philology&mdash;yet that was the
point, and the only point, in which they might have attacked him
successfully; he was vulnerable there.&nbsp; How was this?&nbsp;
Why, in order to have an opportunity of holding up pseudo-critics
by the tails, he wilfully spelt various foreign words
wrong&mdash;Welsh words, and even Italian words&mdash;did they
detect these mis-spellings?&nbsp; Not one of them, even as he
knew they would not, and he now taunts them with ignorance; and
the power of taunting them with ignorance is the punishment which
he designed for them&mdash;a power which they might, but for
their ignorance, have used against him.&nbsp; The writer, besides
knowing something of Italian and Welsh, knows a little of
Armenian language and literature; but who, knowing anything of
the Armenian language, unless he had an end in view, would say
that the word for sea in Armenian is anything like the word tide
in English?&nbsp; The word for sea in Armenian is dzow, a word
connected with the Tebetian word for water, and the Chinese shuy,
and the Turkish su, signifying the same thing; but where is the
resemblance between dzow and tide?&nbsp; Again, the word for
bread in ancient Armenian is hats; yet the Armenian on London
Bridge is made to say zhats, which is not the nominative of the
Armenian noun for bread, but the accusative.&nbsp; Now, critics,
ravening against a man because he is a gentleman and a scholar,
and has not only the power but also the courage to write original
works, why did not you discover that weak point?&nbsp; Why,
because you were ignorant; so here ye are held up!&nbsp;
Moreover, who with a name commencing with Z, ever wrote fables in
Armenian?&nbsp; There are two writers of fables in
Armenian&mdash;Varthan and Koscht, and illustrious writers they
are, one in the simple and the other in the ornate style of
Armenian composition, but neither of their names begins with a
Z.&nbsp; Oh, what a precious opportunity ye lost, ye ravening
crew, of convicting the poor, half-starved, friendless boy of the
book, of ignorance or misrepresentation, by asking who with a
name beginning with Z ever wrote fables in Armenian; but ye
couldn&rsquo;t help yourselves, ye are duncie.&nbsp; We
duncie!&nbsp; Ay, duncie.&nbsp; So here ye are held up by the
tails, blood and foam streaming from your jaws.</p>
<p>The writer wishes to ask here, what do you think of all this,
Messieurs les Critiques?&nbsp; Were ye ever served so
before?&nbsp; But <!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>don&rsquo;t you richly deserve
it?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you been for years past bullying and
insulting everybody whom you deemed weak, and currying favour
with everybody whom ye thought strong?&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>We</i>
approve of this.&nbsp; We disapprove of that.&nbsp; Oh, this will
never do.&nbsp; These are fine lines!&rsquo;&nbsp; The lines
perhaps some horrid sycophantic rubbish addressed to Wellington,
or Lord So-and-so.&nbsp; To have your ignorance thus exposed, to
be shown up in this manner, and by whom?&nbsp; A gypsy!&nbsp; Ay,
a gypsy was the very right person to do it.&nbsp; But is it not
galling after all?</p>
<p>Ah, but <i>we</i> don&rsquo;t understand Armenian, it cannot
be expected that <i>we</i> should understand Armenian, or Welsh,
or&mdash;&nbsp; Hey, what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; The mighty
<i>we</i> not understand Armenian, or Welsh, or&mdash;&nbsp; Then
why does the mighty <i>we</i> pretend to review a book like
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo;?&nbsp; From the arrogance with which it
continually delivers itself, one would think that the mighty
<i>we</i> is omniscient; that it understands every language; is
versed in every literature; yet the mighty <i>we</i> does not
even know the word for bread in Armenian.&nbsp; It knows bread
well enough by name in English, and frequently bread in England
only by its name, but the truth is, that the mighty <i>we</i>,
with all its pretension, is in general a very sorry creature,
who, instead of saying nous disons, should rather say nous dis:
Porny in his &lsquo;Guerre des Dieux,&rsquo; very profanely makes
the three in one say, Je faisons; now, Lavengro, who is anything
but profane, would suggest that critics, especially magazine and
Sunday newspaper critics, should commence with nous dis, as the
first word would be significant of the conceit and assumption of
the critic, and the second of the extent of the critic&rsquo;s
information.&nbsp; The <i>we</i> says its say, but when fawning
sycophancy or vulgar abuse are taken from that say, what
remains?&nbsp; Why a blank, a void like Ginnungagap.</p>
<p>As the writer, of his own accord, has exposed some of the
blemishes of his book&mdash;a task, which a competent critic
ought to have done&mdash;he will now point out two or three of
its merits, which any critic, not altogether blinded with
ignorance, might have done, or not replete with gall and envy
would have been glad to do.&nbsp; The book has the merit of
communicating a fact connected with physiology, which in all the
pages of the multitude of books was never previously
mentioned&mdash;the mysterious practice of touching objects to
baffle the evil chance.&nbsp; The miserable detractor will, of
course, instantly begin to rave about such a habit being
common&mdash;well and good; but was it ever before described in
print, or all connected with it dissected?&nbsp; He may then
vociferate something about Johnson having touched&mdash;the
writer cares not whether Johnson&mdash;who, by the by, during the
last twenty or thirty years, owing to people having become ultra
Tory mad from reading Scott&rsquo;s novels and the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, has been a mighty favourite, especially <!-- page
363--><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>with some who were in the habit of calling him a
half-crazy old fool&mdash;touched, or whether he did not; but he
asks where did Johnson ever describe the feelings which induced
him to perform the magic touch, even supposing that he did
perform it?&nbsp; Again, the history gives an account of a
certain book called the &lsquo;Sleeping Bard,&rsquo; the most
remarkable prose work of the most difficult language but one, of
modern Europe; a book, for a notice of which, he believes, one
might turn over in vain the pages of any review printed in
England, or, indeed, elsewhere.&nbsp; So here are two facts, one
literary and the other physiological, for which any candid critic
was bound to thank the author, even as in &lsquo;The Romany
Rye&rsquo; there is a fact connected with Iro Norman Myth, for
the disclosing of which any person who pretends to have a regard
for literature is bound to thank him, namely, that the mysterious
Finn or Fingal of &lsquo;Ossian&rsquo;s Poems&rsquo; is one and
the same person as the Sigurd Fofnisbane of the Edda and the
Wilkina, and the Siegfried Horn of the Lay of the Niebelungs.</p>
<p>The writer might here conclude, and, he believes, most
triumphantly; as, however, he is in the cue for writing, which he
seldom is, he will for his own gratification, and for the sake of
others, dropping metaphors about vipers and serpents, show up in
particular two or three sets or cliques of people, who, he is
happy to say, have been particularly virulent against him and his
work, for nothing indeed could have given him greater
mortification than their praise.</p>
<p>In the first place, he wishes to dispose of certain
individuals who call themselves men of wit and
fashion&mdash;about town&mdash;who he is told have abused his
book &lsquo;vaustly&rsquo;&mdash;their own word.&nbsp; These
people paint their cheeks, wear white kid gloves, and dabble in
literature, or what they conceive to be literature.&nbsp; For
abuse from such people, the writer was prepared.&nbsp; Does
anyone imagine that the writer was not well aware, before he
published his book, that, whenever he gave it to the world, he
should be attacked by every literary coxcomb in England who had
influence enough to procure the insertion of a scurrilous article
in a magazine or newspaper!&nbsp; He has been in Spain, and has
seen how invariably the mule attacks the horse; now why does the
mule attack the horse?&nbsp; Why, because the latter carries
about with him that which the envious hermaphrodite does not
possess.</p>
<p>They consider, forsooth, that his book is low&mdash;but he is
not going to waste words about them&mdash;one or two of whom, he
is told, have written very duncie books about Spain, and are
highly enraged with him, because certain books which he wrote
about Spain were not considered duncie.&nbsp; No, he is not going
to waste words upon them, for verily he dislikes their company,
and so he&rsquo;ll pass them by, and proceed to others.</p>
<p><!-- page 364--><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>The Scotch Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people have
been very loud in the abuse of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo;&mdash;this
again might be expected; the sarcasms of the Priest about the
Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense of course stung them.&nbsp;
Oh! it is one of the claims which &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; has to
respect, that it is the first, if not the only work, in which
that nonsense is, to a certain extent, exposed.&nbsp; Two or
three of their remarks on passages of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; he
will reproduce and laugh at.&nbsp; Of course your Charlie
o&rsquo;er the water people are genteel exceedingly, and cannot
abide anything low.&nbsp; Gypsyism they think is particularly
low, and the use of gypsy words in literature beneath its
gentility; so they object to gypsy words being used in
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; where gypsies are introduced
speaking.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is Romany forsooth?&rsquo; say
they.&nbsp; Very good!&nbsp; And what is Scotch?&nbsp; Has not
the public been nauseated with Scotch for the last thirty
years?&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, but Scotch is not&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; The
writer believes he knows much better than the Scotch what Scotch
is, and what it is not; he has told them before what it is, a
very sorry jargon.&nbsp; He will now tell them what it&rsquo;s
not&mdash;a sister or an immediate daughter of the Sanscrit,
which Romany is.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ay, but the Scotch
are&rsquo;&mdash;foxes, foxes, nothing else than foxes, even like
the gypsies&mdash;the difference between the gypsy and Scotch fox
being that the first is wild, with a mighty brush, the other a
sneak, with a gilt collar and without a tail.</p>
<p>A Charlie o&rsquo;er the water person attempts to be witty
because the writer has said that perhaps a certain old Edinburgh
high-school porter, of the name of Boee, was perhaps of the same
blood as a certain Bui, a Northern Kemp, who distinguished
himself at the battle of Horinger Bay.&nbsp; A pretty matter,
forsooth, to excite the ridicule of a Scotchman!&nbsp; Why, is
there a beggar or trumpery fellow in Scotland who does not
pretend to be somebody, or related to somebody?&nbsp; Is not
every Scotchman descended from some king, kemp, or cow-stealer of
old, by his own account at least?&nbsp; Why, the writer would
even go so far as to bet a trifle that the poor creature who
ridicules Boee&rsquo;s supposed ancestry has one of his own, at
least, as grand and as apocryphal as old Boee&rsquo;s of the high
school.</p>
<p>The same Charlie o&rsquo;er the water person is mightily
indignant that Lavengro should have spoken disrespectfully of
William Wallace; Lavengro, when he speaks of that personage,
being a child of about ten years old, and repeating merely what
he had heard.&nbsp; All the Scotch, by-the-by, for a great many
years past, have been great admirers of William Wallace,
particularly the Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people, who in
their nonsense-verses about Charlie generally contrive to bring
in the name of William, Willie, or Wullie Wallace.&nbsp; The
writer begs leave to say that he by no means wishes to bear hard
against William Wallace, but he cannot help asking why, if
William, Willie, or Wullie <!-- page 365--><a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>Wallace was
such a particularly nice person, did his brother Scots betray him
to a certain renowned southern warrior, called Edward Longshanks,
who caused him to be hanged and cut into four in London, and his
quarters to be placed over the gates of certain towns?&nbsp; They
got gold, it is true, and titles, very nice things no doubt; but
surely the life of a patriot is better than all the gold and
titles in the world&mdash;at least, Lavengro thinks so; but
Lavengro has lived more with gypsies than Scotchmen, and gypsies
do not betray their brothers.&nbsp; It would be some time before
a gypsy would hand over his brother to the harum-beck, <a
name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a> even supposing you would not only make
him a king, but a justice of the peace, and not only give him the
world, but the best farm on the Holkham estate; but gypsies are
wild foxes, and there is certainly a wonderful difference between
the way of thinking of the wild fox who retains his brush, and
that of the scurvy kennel creature who has lost his tail.</p>
<p>Ah! but thousands of Scotch, and particularly the Charlie
o&rsquo;er the water people, will say: &lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t
sell Willie Wallace; it was our forbears who sold Willie Wallace.
. . .&nbsp; If Edward Longshanks had asked us to sell Wullie
Wallace we would soon have shown him that&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp;
Lord better ye, ye poor trumpery set of creatures, ye would not
have acted a bit better than your forefathers; remember how ye
have ever treated the few amongst ye who, though born in the
kennel, have shown something of the spirit of the wood.&nbsp;
Many of ye are still alive who delivered over men, quite as
honest and patriotic as William Wallace, into the hands of an
English minister, to be chained and transported for merely
venturing to speak and write in the cause of humanity, at the
time when Europe was beginning to fling off the chains imposed by
kings and priests.&nbsp; And it is not so very long since Burns,
to whom ye are now building up obelisks rather higher than he
deserves, was permitted by his countrymen to die in poverty and
misery because he would not join with them in songs of adulation
to kings and the trumpery great.&nbsp; So say not that ye would
have acted with respect to William Wallace one whit better than
your fathers; and you in particular, ye children of Charlie, whom
do ye write nonsense-verses about?&nbsp; A family of dastard
despots, who did their best, during a century and more, to tread
out the few sparks of independent feeling still glowing in
Scotland; but enough has been said about ye.</p>
<p>Amongst those who have been prodigal in abuse and defamation
of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; have been your modern Radicals, and
particularly a set of people who filled the country with noise
against the King and Queen, Wellington and the Tories, in
&rsquo;32.&nbsp; About these people the writer will presently
have occasion to say a <!-- page 366--><a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>good deal,
and also of real Radicals.&nbsp; As, however, it may be supposed
that he is one of those who delight to play the sycophant to
kings and queens, to curry favour with Tories, and to bepraise
Wellington, he begs leave to state that such is not the case.</p>
<p>About kings and queens he has nothing to say; about Tories
simply that he believes them to be a bad set; about Wellington,
however, it will be necessary for him to say a good deal of mixed
import, as he will subsequently frequently have occasion to
mention him in connection with what he has to say about
pseudo-Radicals.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;PSEUDO-RADICALS</h2>
<p>About Wellington, then, he says, that he believes him at the
present day to be infinitely overrated.&nbsp; But there certainly
was a time when he was shamefully underrated.&nbsp; Now what time
was that?&nbsp; Why, the time of pseudo-Radicalism, par
excellence, from &rsquo;20 to &rsquo;32.&nbsp; Oh! the abuse that
was heaped on Wellington by those who traded in Radical
cant&mdash;your newspaper editors and review writers! and how he
was sneered at then by your Whigs, and how faintly supported he
was by your Tories, who were half ashamed of him; for your
Tories, though capital fellows as followers, when you want nobody
to back you, are the faintest creatures in the world when you cry
in your agony, &lsquo;Come and help me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh!
assuredly Wellington was infamously used at that time, especially
by your traders in Radicalism, who howled at and hooted him; said
he had every vice&mdash;was no general&mdash;was beaten at
Waterloo&mdash;was a poltroon&mdash;moreover a poor illiterate
creature, who could scarcely read or write; nay, a principal
Radical paper said bodily he could not read, and devised an
ingenious plan for teaching Wellington how to read.&nbsp; Now
this was too bad; and the writer, being a lover of justice,
frequently spoke up for Wellington, saying, that as for vice, he
was not worse than his neighbours; that he was brave; that he won
the fight at Waterloo, from a half-dead man, it is true, but that
he did win it.&nbsp; Also, that he believed he had read
&lsquo;Rules for the Manual and Platoon Exercises&rsquo; to some
purpose; moreover, that he was sure he could write, for that he
the writer had once written to Wellington, and had received an
answer from him; nay, the writer once went so far as to strike a
blow for Wellington; for the last time he used his fists was upon
a Radical sub-editor, who was mobbing Wellington in the street,
from behind a rank of grimy fellows; but though the writer spoke
up for Wellington to a certain extent when he was <!-- page
367--><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>shamefully underrated, and once struck a blow for him
when he was about being hustled, he is not going to join in the
loathsome sycophantic nonsense which it has been the fashion to
use with respect to Wellington these last twenty years.&nbsp; Now
what have those years been to England?&nbsp; Why the years of
ultra-gentility, everybody in England having gone gentility mad
during the last twenty years, and no people more so than your
pseudo-Radicals.&nbsp; Wellington was turned out, and your Whigs
and Radicals got in, and then commenced the period of
ultra-gentility in England.&nbsp; The Whigs and Radicals only
hated Wellington as long as the patronage of the country was in
his hands, none of which they were tolerably sure he would bestow
on them; but no sooner did they get it into their own, than they
forthwith became admirers of Wellington.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp;
Because he was a duke, petted at Windsor and by foreign princes,
and a very genteel personage.&nbsp; Formerly many of your Whigs
and Radicals had scarcely a decent coat on their backs; but now
the plunder of the country was at their disposal, and they had as
good a chance of being genteel as any people.&nbsp; So they were
willing to worship Wellington because he was very genteel, and
could not keep the plunder of the country out of their
hands.&nbsp; And Wellington has been worshipped, and prettily so,
during the last fifteen or twenty years.&nbsp; He is now a noble
fine-hearted creature; the greatest general the world ever
produced; the bravest of men; and&mdash;and&mdash;mercy upon us!
the greatest of military writers!&nbsp; Now the present writer
will not join in such sycophancy.&nbsp; As he was not afraid to
take the part of Wellington when he was scurvily used by all
parties, and when it was dangerous to take his part, so he is not
afraid to speak the naked truth about Wellington in these days,
when it is dangerous to say anything about him but what is
sycophantically laudatory.&nbsp; He said, in &rsquo;32, that as
to vice, Wellington was not worse than his neighbours; but he is
not going to say, in &rsquo;54, that Wellington was a
noble-hearted fellow; for he believes that a more cold-hearted
individual never existed.&nbsp; His conduct to Warner, the poor
Vaudois, and Marshal Ney, showed that.&nbsp; He said, in
&rsquo;32, that he was a good general and a brave man; but he is
not going, in &rsquo;54, to say that he was the best general, or
the bravest man the world ever saw.&nbsp; England has produced a
better general&mdash;France two or three&mdash;both countries
many braver men.&nbsp; The son of the Norfolk clergyman was a
braver man; Marshal Ney was a braver man.&nbsp; Oh, that Battle
of Copenhagen!&nbsp; Oh, that covering the retreat of the Grand
Army!&nbsp; And though he said in &rsquo;32 that he could write,
he is not going to say in &rsquo;54 that he is the best of all
military writers.&nbsp; On the contrary, he does not hesitate to
say that any Commentary of Julius C&aelig;sar, or any chapter in
Justinus, more especially the one about the Parthians, is worth
the ten volumes of Wellington&rsquo;s Despatches; though he <!--
page 368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>has no doubt that, by saying so, he shall especially
rouse the indignation of a certain newspaper, at present one of
the most genteel journals imaginable&mdash;with a slight tendency
to Liberalism, it is true, but perfectly genteel&mdash;which is
nevertheless the very one which, in &rsquo;32, swore bodily that
Wellington could neither read nor write, and devised an ingenious
plan for teaching him how to read.</p>
<p>Now, after the above statement no one will venture to say, if
the writer should be disposed to bear hard upon Radicals, that he
would be influenced by a desire to pay court to princes, or to
curry favour with Tories, or from being a blind admirer of the
Duke of Wellington; but the writer is not going to declaim
against Radicals, that is, real Republicans, or their principles;
upon the whole, he is something of an admirer of both.&nbsp; The
writer has always had as much admiration for everything that is
real and honest as he has had contempt for the opposite.&nbsp;
Now, real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, a much
finer thing than Toryism, a system of common robbery, which is,
nevertheless, far better than Whiggism <a
name="citation368"></a><a href="#footnote368"
class="citation">[368]</a>&mdash;a compound of petty larceny,
popular instruction, and receiving of stolen goods.&nbsp; Yes,
real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, and your real
Radicals and Republicans are certainly very fine fellows, or
rather were fine fellows, for the Lord only knows where to find
them at the present day&mdash;the writer does not.&nbsp; If he
did he would at any time go five miles to invite one of them to
dinner, even supposing that he had to go to a workhouse in order
to find the person he wished to invite.&nbsp; Amongst the real
Radicals of England, those who flourished from the year &rsquo;16
to &rsquo;20, there were certainly extraordinary characters, men
partially insane, perhaps, but honest and brave&mdash;they did
not make a market of <!-- page 369--><a name="page369"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 369</span>the principles which they professed,
and never intended to do so; they believed in them, and were
willing to risk their lives in endeavouring to carry them
out.&nbsp; The writer wishes to speak in particular of two of
these men, both of whom perished on the scaffold&mdash;their
names were Thistlewood and Ings. <a name="citation369"></a><a
href="#footnote369" class="citation">[369]</a>&nbsp; Thistlewood,
the best known of them, was a brave soldier, and had served with
distinction as an officer in the French service; he was one of
the excellent swordsmen of Europe; had fought several duels in
France, where it is no child&rsquo;s play to fight a duel; but
had never unsheathed his sword for single combat, but in defence
of the feeble and insulted.&nbsp; He was kind and open-hearted,
but of too great simplicity; he had once ten thousand pounds left
him, all of which he lent to a friend, who disappeared and never
returned him a penny.&nbsp; Ings was an uneducated man, of very
low stature, but amazing strength and resolution; he was a kind
husband and father, and though a humble butcher, the name he bore
was one of the royal names of the heathen Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp;
These two men, along with five others, were executed, and their
heads hacked off, for levying war against George the Fourth; the
whole seven dying in a manner which extorted cheers from the
populace; the most of them uttering philosophical or patriotic
sayings.&nbsp; Thistlewood, who was, perhaps, the most calm and
collected of all, just before he was turned off, said: &lsquo;We
are now going to discover the great secret.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ings,
the moment before he was choked, was singing &lsquo;Scots wha
ha&rsquo; wi&rsquo; Wallace bled.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now, there was no
humbug about those men, nor about many more of the same time and
of the same principles.&nbsp; They might be deluded about
Republicanism, as Algernon Sidney was, and as Brutus was, but
they were as honest and brave as either Brutus or Sidney, and as
willing to die for their principles.&nbsp; But the Radicals who
succeeded them were beings of a very different description; they
jobbed and traded in Republicanism, and either parted with it, or
at the present day are eager to part with it for a
consideration.&nbsp; In order to get the Whigs into power, and
themselves places, they brought the country by their inflammatory
language to the verge of a revolution, and were the cause that
many perished on the scaffold; by their incendiary harangues and
newspaper articles they caused the Bristol conflagration, for
which six poor creatures were executed; they encouraged the mob
to pillage, pull down and burn, and then rushing into garrets
looked on.&nbsp; Thistlewood tells the mob the Tower is a second
Bastile; let it be pulled down.&nbsp; A mob tries to pull down
the Tower; but Thistlewood is at the head of that mob; he is not
peeping from a garret on Tower Hill like Gulliver at
Lisbon.&nbsp; Thistlewood and Ings say to twenty ragged
individuals, Liverpool <!-- page 370--><a
name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 370</span>and
Castlereagh are two satellites of despotism; it would be highly
desirable to put them out of the way.&nbsp; And a certain number
of ragged individuals are surprised in a stable in Cato Street,
making preparations to put Castlereagh and Liverpool out of the
way, and are fired upon with muskets by Grenadiers, and are
hacked at with cutlasses by Bow Street runners; but the twain who
encouraged those ragged individuals to meet in Cato Street are
not far off, they are not on the other side of the river, in the
Borough, for example, in some garret or obscure cellar.&nbsp; The
very first to confront the Guards and runners are Thistlewood and
Ings; Thistlewood whips his long thin rapier through
Smithers&rsquo; lungs, and Ings makes a dash at Fitzclarence with
his butcher&rsquo;s knife.&nbsp; Oh, there was something in those
fellows!&mdash;honesty and courage!&mdash;but can as much be said
for the inciters of the troubles of &rsquo;32.&nbsp; No; they
egged on poor ignorant mechanics and rustics, and got them hanged
for pulling down and burning, whilst the highest pitch to which
their own daring ever mounted was to mob Wellington as he passed
in the streets.</p>
<p>Now, these people were humbugs, which Thistlewood and Ings
were not.&nbsp; They raved and foamed against kings, queens,
Wellington, the aristocracy, and what not, till they had got the
Whigs into power, with whom they were in secret alliance, and
with whom they afterwards openly joined in a system of robbery
and corruption, more flagitious than the old Tory one, because
there was more cant about it; for themselves they got
consulships, commissionerships, and in some instances
governments; for their sons clerkships in public offices; and
there you may see those sons with the never-failing badge of the
low scoundrel-puppy, the gilt chain at the waistcoat pocket; and
there you may hear and see them using the languishing tones, and
employing the airs and graces which wenches use and employ who,
without being in the family way, wish to make their keepers
believe that they are in the family way.&nbsp; Assuredly great is
the cleverness of your Radicals of &rsquo;32, in providing for
themselves and their families.&nbsp; Yet, clever as they are,
there is one thing they cannot do&mdash;they get governments for
themselves, commissionerships for their brothers, clerkships for
their sons, but there is one thing beyond their craft&mdash;they
cannot get husbands for their daughters, who, too ugly for
marriage, and with their heads filled with the nonsense they have
imbibed from gentility novels, go over from Socinus to the Pope,
becoming sisters in fusty convents, or having heard a few sermons
in Mr. Platitude&rsquo;s &lsquo;chapelle,&rsquo; seek for
admission at the establishment of mother S---, who, after
employing them for a time in various menial offices, and making
them pluck off their eyebrows hair by hair, generally dismisses
them on the plea of sluttishness; whereupon they return to their
papas to eat the bread of the country, with <!-- page 371--><a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>the
comfortable prospect of eating it still in the shape of a pension
after their sires are dead.&nbsp; Papa (ex uno disce omnes)
living as quietly as he can; not exactly enviably it is true,
being now and then seen to cast an uneasy and furtive glance
behind, even as an animal is wont who has lost by some mischance
a very sightly appendage; as quietly however as he can, and as
dignifiedly, a great admirer of every genteel thing and genteel
personage, the Duke in particular, whose
&lsquo;Despatches,&rsquo; bound in red morocco, you will find on
his table.&nbsp; A disliker of coarse expressions and extremes of
every kind, with a perfect horror for revolutions and attempts to
revolutionize, exclaiming now and then, as a shriek escapes from
whipped and bleeding Hungary, a groan from gasping Poland, and a
half-stifled curse from down-trodden but scowling Italy,
&lsquo;Confound the revolutionary canaille, why can&rsquo;t it be
quiet!&rsquo;&nbsp; In a word, putting one in mind of the parvenu
in the &lsquo;Walpurgis Nacht.&rsquo;&nbsp; The writer is no
admirer of G&ouml;the, but the idea of that parvenu was certainly
a good one.&nbsp; Yes, putting one in mind of the individual who
says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Wir waren wahrlich auch nicht dumm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und thaten oft was wir nicht sollten;<br />
Doch jetzo kehrt sich alles um und um,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und eben da wir&rsquo;s fest erhalten
wollten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;We were no fools, as every one discern&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stopp&rsquo;d at nought our projects in
fulfilling;<br />
But now the world seems topsy-turvy turn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep it quiet just when we were
willing.&rsquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this class of individuals entertain a mortal hatred for
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and its writer, and never lose an
opportunity of vituperating both.&nbsp; It is true that such
hatred is by no means surprising.&nbsp; There is certainly a
great deal of difference between Lavengro and their own sons; the
one thinking of independence and philology, whilst he is clinking
away at kettles, and hammering horse-shoes in dingles; the others
stuck up at public offices with gilt chains at their
waistcoat-pockets, and giving themselves the airs and graces of
females of a certain description.&nbsp; And there certainly
<i>is</i> a great deal of difference between the author of
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and themselves&mdash;he retaining his
principles and his brush; they with scarlet breeches on, it is
true, but without their republicanism and their tails.&nbsp; Oh,
the writer can well afford to be vituperated by your
pseudo-Radicals of &rsquo;32!</p>
<p>Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical <a

rich not to require a chapter to itself.</p>

RADICAL</h2>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This very dirty man, with his very dirty
face,<br />
Would do any dirty act, which would get him a place.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and
his wife; but before he relates the manner in which they set upon
him, it will be as well to enter upon a few particulars tending
to elucidate their reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The writer had just entered into his eighteenth year, when he
met at the table of a certain Anglo-Germanist <a
name="citation372a"></a><a href="#footnote372a"
class="citation">[372a]</a> an individual apparently somewhat
under thirty, of middle stature, a thin and weaselly figure, a
sallow complexion, a certain obliquity of vision, and a large
pair of spectacles.&nbsp; This person, who had lately come from
abroad, and had published a volume of translations, <a
name="citation372b"></a><a href="#footnote372b"
class="citation">[372b]</a> had attracted some slight notice in
the literary world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion in a
small provincial capital.&nbsp; After dinner he argued a great
deal, spoke vehemently against the Church, and uttered the most
desperate Radicalism that was perhaps ever heard, saying he hoped
that in a short time there would not be a king or queen in
Europe, and inveighing bitterly against the English aristocracy,
and against the Duke of Wellington in particular, whom he said,
if he himself was ever president of an English republic&mdash;an
event which he seemed to think by no means improbable&mdash;he
would hang for certain infamous acts of profligacy and bloodshed
which he had perpetrated in Spain.&nbsp; Being informed that the
writer was something of a philologist, to which character the
individual in question laid great pretensions, he came and sat
down by him, and talked about languages and literature.&nbsp; The
writer, who was only a boy, was a little frightened at first,
but, not wishing to appear a child of absolute ignorance, he
summoned what little learning he had, and began to blunder out
something about the Celtic languages and their literature, and
asked the Lion who he conceived Finn Ma Coul to be? and whether
he did not consider the &lsquo;Ode to the Fox,&rsquo; by Red Rhys
of Eryry, to be a masterpiece of pleasantry?&nbsp; Receiving no
answer to these questions from the Lion, who, singular enough,
would frequently, when the writer put a question to him, look
across the table and flatly contradict some one who was talking
to some other person, the writer dropped the Celtic languages and
literature, and asked him whether he did not think it a funny
<!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
373</span>thing that Temugin, generally called Genghis Khan,
should have married the daughter of Prester John? <a
name="citation373"></a><a href="#footnote373"
class="citation">[373]</a>&nbsp; The Lion, after giving a
side-glance at the writer through his left spectacle glass,
seemed about to reply, but was unfortunately prevented, being
seized with an irresistible impulse to contradict a respectable
doctor of medicine, who was engaged in conversation with the
master of the house at the upper and further end of the table,
the writer being a poor ignorant lad, sitting, of course, at the
bottom.&nbsp; The doctor, who had served in the Peninsula, having
observed that Ferdinand the Seventh was not quite so bad as had
been represented, the Lion vociferated that he was ten times
worse, and that he hoped to see him and the Duke of Wellington
hanged together.&nbsp; The doctor who, being a Welshman, was
somewhat of a warm temper, growing rather red, said that at any
rate he had been informed that Ferdinand the Seventh knew
sometimes how to behave himself like a gentleman.&nbsp; This
brought on a long dispute, which terminated rather
abruptly.&nbsp; The Lion having observed that the doctor must not
talk about Spanish matters with one who had visited every part of
Spain, the doctor bowed, and said that he was right, for that he
believed no people in general possessed such accurate information
about countries as those who had travelled them as bagmen.&nbsp;
On the Lion asking the doctor what he meant, the Welshman, whose
under jaw began to move violently, replied that he meant what he
said.&nbsp; Here the matter ended, for the Lion, turning from
him, looked at the writer.&nbsp; The writer, imagining that his
own conversation hitherto had been too trivial and commonplace
for the Lion to consider it worth his while to take much notice
of it, determined to assume a little higher ground, and after
repeating a few verses of the Koran, and gabbling a little
Arabic, asked the Lion what he considered to be the difference
between the Hegira and the Christian era, adding that he thought
the general computation was in error by about one year; and being
a particularly modest person, chiefly he believes owing to his
having been at school in Ireland, absolutely blushed at finding
that the Lion returned not a word in answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a
wonderful individual I am seated by,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;to
whom Arabic seems a vulgar speech, and a question about the
Hegira not worthy of an answer!&rsquo; not reflecting that as
lions come from the Saharra, they have quite enough of Arabic at
home, and that the question about the Hegira was rather mal
&agrave; propos to one used to prey on the flesh of hadjis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Now I only wish he would vouchsafe me a little of his
learning,&rsquo; thought the boy to himself, and in this wish he
was at last gratified, for the Lion, after asking him whether he
was acquainted at all with the Sclavonian languages, and being
informed that he was not, absolutely dumbfoundered him by a
display of Sclavonian erudition.</p>
<p><!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>Years rolled by&mdash;the writer was a good deal about,
sometimes in London, sometimes in the country, sometimes abroad;
in London he occasionally met the man of the spectacles, who was
always very civil to him, and, indeed, cultivated his
acquaintance.&nbsp; The writer thought it rather odd that, after
he himself had become acquainted with the Sclavonian languages
and literature, the man of the spectacles talked little or
nothing about them.&nbsp; In a little time, however, the matter
ceased to cause him the slightest surprise, for he had discovered
a key to the mystery.&nbsp; In the meantime the man of the
spectacles was busy enough; he speculated in commerce, failed,
and paid his creditors twenty pennies in the pound; published
translations, of which the public at length became heartily
tired; having, indeed, got an inkling of the manner in which
those translations were got up.&nbsp; He managed, however, to
ride out many a storm, having one trusty
sheet-anchor&mdash;Radicalism.&nbsp; This he turned to the best
advantage&mdash;writing pamphlets and articles in reviews, all in
the Radical interest, and for which he was paid out of the
Radical fund; which articles and pamphlets, when Toryism seemed
to reel on its last legs, exhibited a slight tendency to
Whiggism.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his abhorrence of desertion of
principle was so great in the time of the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s administration, that when S--- <a
name="citation374"></a><a href="#footnote374"
class="citation">[374]</a> left the Whigs and went over, he told
the writer, who was about that time engaged with him in a
literary undertaking, that the said S--- was a fellow with a
character so infamous, that any honest man would rather that you
should spit in his face than insult his ears with the mention of
the name of S---.</p>
<p>The literary project having come to nothing&mdash;in which,
by-the-by, the writer was to have all the labour, and his friend
all the credit, provided any credit should accrue from
it&mdash;the writer did not see the latter for some years, during
which time considerable political changes took place; the Tories
were driven from, and the Whigs placed in, office, both events
being brought about by the Radicals coalescing with the Whigs,
over whom they possessed great influence for the services which
they had rendered.&nbsp; When the writer next visited his friend
he found him very much altered; his opinions were by no means so
exalted as they had been&mdash;he was not disposed even to be
rancorous against the Duke of Wellington, saying that there were
worse men than he, and giving him some credit as a general; a
hankering after gentility seeming to pervade the whole family,
father and sons, wife and daughters, all of whom talked about
genteel diversions&mdash;gentility novels, and even seemed to
look with favour on high Churchism, having in former years, to
all appearance, been bigoted Dissenters.&nbsp; In a little time
the writer went abroad, as, indeed, did his friend; not, however,
like the <!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>writer, at his own expense, but at
that of the country&mdash;the Whigs having given him a travelling
appointment, which he held for some years, during which he is
said to have received upwards of twelve thousand pounds of the
money of the country, for services which will, perhaps, be found
inscribed on certain tablets when another Astolfo shall visit the
moon.&nbsp; This appointment, however, he lost on the Tories
resuming power&mdash;when the writer found him almost as radical
and patriotic as ever, just engaged in trying to get into
Parliament, into which he got by the assistance of his Radical
friends, who, in conjunction with the Whigs, were just getting up
a crusade against the Tories, which they intended should be a
conclusive one.</p>
<p>A little time after the publication of &lsquo;The Bible in
Spain,&rsquo; the Tories being still in power, this individual,
full of the most disinterested friendship for the author, was
particularly anxious that he should be presented with an official
situation in a certain region a great many miles off.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are the only person for that appointment,&rsquo; said
he; &lsquo;you understand a great deal about the country, and are
better acquainted with the two languages spoken there than anyone
in England.&nbsp; Now, I love my country, and have, moreover, a
great regard for you, and as I am in Parliament, and have
frequent opportunities of speaking to the Ministry, I shall take
care to tell them how desirable it would be to secure your
services.&nbsp; It is true they are Tories, but I think that even
Tories would give up their habitual love of jobbery in a case
like yours, and for once show themselves disposed to be honest
men and gentlemen; indeed, I have no doubt they will, for having
so deservedly an infamous character, they would be glad to get
themselves a little credit by a presentation which could not
possibly be traced to jobbery or favouritism.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
writer begged his friend to give himself no trouble about the
matter, as he was not desirous of the appointment, being in
tolerably easy circumstances, and willing to take some rest after
a life of labour.&nbsp; All, however, that he could say was of no
use, his friend indignantly observing that the matter ought to be
taken entirely out of his hands, and the appointment thrust upon
him for the credit of the country.&nbsp; &lsquo;But may not many
people be far more worthy of the appointment than myself?&rsquo;
said the writer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; said the friendly
Radical.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t get it it will be made a
job of, given to the son of some steward, or, perhaps, to some
quack who has done dirty work.&nbsp; I tell you what, I shall ask
it for you, in spite of you; I shall, indeed!&rsquo; and his eyes
flashed with friendly and patriotic fervour through the large
pair of spectacles which he wore.</p>
<p>And, in fact, it would appear that the honest and friendly
patriot put his threat into execution.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
spoken,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;more than once to this and that
individual in Parliament, and everybody seems to think that the
appointment should be given <!-- page 376--><a
name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>to
you.&nbsp; Nay, that you should be forced to accept it.&nbsp; I
intend next to speak to Lord A---.&rsquo; <a
name="citation376a"></a><a href="#footnote376a"
class="citation">[376a]</a>&nbsp; And so he did, at least, it
would appear so.&nbsp; On the writer calling upon him one
evening, about a week afterwards, in order to take leave of him,
as the writer was about to take a long journey for the sake of
his health, his friend no sooner saw him than he started up in a
violent fit of agitation, and glancing about the room, in which
there were several people, amongst others two Whig members of
Parliament, said: &lsquo;I am glad you are come, I was just
speaking about you.&nbsp; This,&rsquo; said he, addressing the
two members, &lsquo;is so-and-so, the author of so-and-so, the
well-known philologist; as I was telling you, I spoke to Lord
A--- this day about him, and said that he ought forthwith to have
the head appointment in ---; <a name="citation376b"></a><a
href="#footnote376b" class="citation">[376b]</a> and what did the
fellow say?&nbsp; Why, that there was no necessity for such an
appointment at all, and if there were, why&mdash;And then he
hummed and ha&rsquo;d.&nbsp; Yes,&rsquo; said he, looking at the
writer, &lsquo;he did, indeed.&nbsp; What a scandal! what an
infamy!&nbsp; But I see how it will be, it will be a job.&nbsp;
The place will be given to some son of a steward or to some
quack, as I said before.&nbsp; Oh, these Tories!&nbsp; Well, if
this does not make one&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Here he stopped short,
crunched his teeth, and looked the image of desperation.</p>
<p>Seeing the poor man in this distressed condition, the writer
begged him to be comforted, and not to take the matter so much to
heart; but the indignant Radical took the matter very much to
heart, and refused all comfort whatsoever, bouncing about the
room, and, whilst his spectacles flashed in the light of four
spermaceti candles, exclaiming, &lsquo;It will be a job&mdash;a
Tory job!&nbsp; I see it all, I see it all, I see it
all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And a job it proved, and a very pretty job, but no Tory
job.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the Tories were out, and the Whigs
were in.&nbsp; From that time the writer heard not a word about
the injustice done to the country in not presenting him with the
appointment to ---; the Radical, however, was busy enough to
obtain the appointment, not for the writer, but for himself, and
eventually succeeded, partly through Radical influence, and
partly through that of a certain Whig lord, for whom the Radical
had done, on a particular occasion, work of a particular
kind.&nbsp; So, though the place was given to a quack, and the
whole affair a very pretty job, it was one in which the Tories
had certainly no hand.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, however, the friendly Radical did not drop
the writer.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; On various occasions he obtained
from the writer all the information he could about the country in
question, and was particularly anxious to obtain from the writer,
and eventually did obtain, a copy of a work <a
name="citation376c"></a><a href="#footnote376c"
class="citation">[376c]</a> written in the court language of that
country, edited by the writer&mdash;a language exceedingly
difficult, which the writer, at the expense of a considerable
<!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>portion of his eyesight, had acquired, at least as far
as by the eyesight it could be acquired.&nbsp; What use the
writer&rsquo;s friend made of the knowledge he had gained from
him, and what use he made of the book, the writer can only guess;
but he has little doubt that when the question of sending a
person to --- was mooted in a Parliamentary Committee&mdash;which
it was at the instigation of the Radical supporters of the
writer&rsquo;s friend&mdash;the Radical, on being examined about
the country, gave the information which he had obtained from the
writer as his own, and flashed the book and its singular
characters in the eyes of the Committee; and then, of course, his
Radical friends would instantly say, &lsquo;This is the man!
there is no one like him.&nbsp; See what information he
possesses; and see that book written by himself in the court
language of Serendib.&nbsp; This is the only man to send
there.&nbsp; What a glory, what a triumph it would be to Britain,
to send out a man so deeply versed in the mysterious lore of ---,
as our illustrious countryman&mdash;a person who with his
knowledge could beat with their own weapons the wise men of
---!&nbsp; Is such an opportunity to be lost?&nbsp; Oh, no!
surely not!&nbsp; If it is it will be an eternal disgrace to
England, and the world will see that Whigs are no better than
Tories.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let no one think the writer uncharitable in these
suppositions.&nbsp; The writer is only too well acquainted with
the antecedents of the individual, to entertain much doubt that
he would shrink from any such conduct, provided he thought that
his temporal interest would be forwarded by it.&nbsp; The writer
is aware of more than one instance in which he has passed off the
literature of friendless young men for his own, after making them
a slight pecuniary compensation, and deforming what was
originally excellent by interpolations of his own.&nbsp; This was
his especial practice with regard to translation, of which he
would fain be esteemed the king.&nbsp; This Radical literato is
slightly acquainted with four or five of the easier dialects of
Europe, on the strength of which knowledge he would fain pass for
a universal linguist, publishing translations of pieces
originally written in various difficult languages; which
translations, however, were either made by himself from literal
renderings done for him into French or German, or had been made
from the originals into English, by friendless young men, and
then deformed by his alterations.</p>
<p>Well, the Radical got the appointment, and the writer
certainly did not grudge it him.&nbsp; He, of course, was aware
that his friend had behaved in a very base manner towards him,
but he bore him no ill-will, and invariably when he heard him
spoken against, which was frequently the case, took his part when
no other person would; indeed, he could well afford to bear him
no ill-will.&nbsp; He had never sought for the appointment, nor
wished for it, nor, indeed, ever believed himself qualified for
<!-- page 378--><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>it.&nbsp; He was conscious, it is true, that he was not
altogether unacquainted with the language and literature of the
country with which the appointment was connected.&nbsp; He was
likewise aware that he was not altogether deficient in courage
and in propriety of behaviour.&nbsp; He knew that his appearance
was not particularly against him; his face not being like that of
a convicted pickpocket, nor his gait resembling that of a fox who
has lost his tail; yet he never believed himself adapted for the
appointment, being aware that he had no aptitude for the doing of
dirty work, if called to do it, nor pliancy which would enable
him to submit to scurvy treatment, whether he did dirty work or
not&mdash;requisites, at the time of which he is speaking,
indispensable in every British official; requisites, by-the-by,
which his friend, the Radical, possessed in a high degree; but
though he bore no ill-will towards his friend, his friend bore
anything but good-will towards him; for from the moment that he
had obtained the appointment for himself, his mind was filled
with the most bitter malignity against the writer, and naturally
enough; for no one ever yet behaved in a base manner towards
another, without forthwith conceiving a mortal hatred against
him.&nbsp; You wrong another, know yourself to have acted basely,
and are enraged, not against yourself&mdash;for no one hates
himself&mdash;but against the innocent cause of your baseness;
reasoning very plausibly, &lsquo;But for that fellow, I should
never have been base; for had he not existed I could not have
been so, at any rate against him;&rsquo; and this hatred is all
the more bitter, when you reflect that you have been needlessly
base.</p>
<p>Whilst the Tories are in power the writer&rsquo;s friend, of
his own accord, raves against the Tories because they do not give
the writer a certain appointment, and makes, or says he makes,
desperate exertions to make them do so; but no sooner are the
Tories out, with whom he has no influence, and the Whigs in, with
whom he, or rather his party, has influence, than he gets the
place for himself, though, according to his own expressed
opinion&mdash;an opinion with which the writer does not, and
never did, concur&mdash;the writer was the only person competent
to hold it.&nbsp; Now had he, without saying a word to the
writer, or about the writer with respect to the employment, got
the place for himself when he had an opportunity, knowing, as he
very well knew, himself to be utterly unqualified for it, the
transaction, though a piece of jobbery, would not have merited
the title of a base transaction; as the matter stands, however,
who can avoid calling the whole affair not only a piece
of&mdash;come, come, out with the word&mdash;scoundrelism on the
part of the writer&rsquo;s friend, but a most curious piece of
uncalled-for scoundrelism? and who, with any knowledge of fallen
human nature, can wonder at the writer&rsquo;s friend
entertaining towards him a considerable portion of gall and
malignity!</p>
<p><!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
379</span>This feeling on the part of the writer&rsquo;s friend
was wonderfully increased by the appearance of Lavengro, many
passages of which the Radical in his foreign appointment applied
to himself and family&mdash;one or two of his children having
gone over to Popery, the rest become members of Mr.
Platitude&rsquo;s chapel, and the minds of all being filled with
ultra notions of gentility.</p>
<p>The writer, hearing that his old friend had returned to
England, to apply, he believes, for an increase of salary, and
for a title, called upon him, unwillingly, it is true, for he had
no wish to see a person for whom, though he bore him no ill-will,
he could not avoid feeling a considerable portion of contempt,
the truth is, that his sole object in calling was to endeavour to
get back a piece of literary property which his friend had
obtained from him many years previously, and which, though he had
frequently applied for it, he never could get back.&nbsp; Well,
the writer called; he did not get his property, which, indeed, he
had scarcely time to press for, being almost instantly attacked
by his good friend and his wife&mdash;yes, it was then that the
author was set upon by an old Radical and his wife&mdash;the
wife, who looked the very image of shame and malignity, did not
say much, it is true, but encouraged her husband in all he
said.&nbsp; Both of their own accord introduced the subject of
&lsquo;Lavengro.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Radical called the writer a
grumbler, just as if there had ever been a greater grumbler than
himself until, by the means above described, he had obtained a
place: he said that the book contained a melancholy view of human
nature&mdash;just as if anybody could look in his face without
having a melancholy view of human nature.&nbsp; On the writer
quietly observing that the book contained an exposition of his
principles, the pseudo-Radical replied, that he cared nothing for
his principles&mdash;which was probably true, it not being likely
that he would care for another person&rsquo;s principles after
having shown so thorough a disregard for his own.&nbsp; The
writer said that the book, of course, would give offence to
humbugs; the Radical then demanded whether he thought him a
humbug?&mdash;the wretched wife was the Radical&rsquo;s
protection, even as he knew she would be; it was on her account
that the writer did not kick his good friend; as it was, he
looked at him in the face and thought to himself, &lsquo;How is
it possible I should think you a humbug, when only last night I
was taking your part in a company in which everybody called you a
humbug?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Radical, probably observing something in the
writer&rsquo;s eye which he did not like, became all on a sudden
abjectly submissive, and, professing the highest admiration for
the writer, begged him to visit him in his government; this the
writer promised faithfully to do, and he takes the present
opportunity of performing his promise.</p>
<p>This is one of the pseudo-Radical calumniators of
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; <!-- page 380--><a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>and its
author; were the writer on his death-bed he would lay his hand on
his heart and say, that he does not believe that there is one
trait of exaggeration in the portrait which he has drawn.&nbsp;
This is one of the pseudo-Radical calumniators of
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; and its author; and this is one of the
genus, who, after having railed against jobbery for perhaps a
quarter of a century, at present batten on large official
salaries which they do not earn.&nbsp; England is a great
country, and her interests require that she should have many a
well-paid official both at home and abroad; but will England long
continue a great country if the care of her interests both at
home and abroad, is in many instances entrusted to beings like
him described above, whose only recommendation for an official
appointment was that he was deeply versed in the secrets of his
party and of the Whigs?</p>
<p>Before he concludes, the writer will take the liberty of
saying of &lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; that it is a book written for
the express purpose of inculcating virtue, love of country,
learning, manly pursuits, and genuine religion, for example, that
of the Church of England, and for awakening a contempt for
nonsense of every kind, and a hatred for priestcraft, more
especially that of Rome.</p>
<p>And in conclusion, with respect to many passages of his book,
in which he has expressed himself in terms neither measured nor
mealy, he will beg leave to observe, in the words of a great
poet, who lived a profligate life it is true, but who died a
sincere penitent&mdash;thanks, after God, to good Bishop
Burnet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;All this with indignation I have
hurl&rsquo;d<br />
At the pretending part of this proud world,<br />
Who, swollen with selfish vanity, devise<br />
False freedoms, formal cheats, and holy lies,<br />
Over their fellow fools to tyrannize.&rsquo;</p>

appointment at the Welsh border.&nbsp; But extraordinary
rencontres are commonplace in Borrow&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; He
meets the Apple-woman&rsquo;s Armenian customer and restores his
purse, he meets Ardrey as he is leaving London, and later at the
inn on the Great North Road, where he also meets the Man in
Black, Mr. Platitude, and the Postillion.&nbsp; He meets the
Apple-woman&rsquo;s son after leaving Salisbury, and six days
later meets Slingsby, whom he had met as a boy at Tamworth.&nbsp;
He meets Mrs. Herne&mdash;or, rather, she meets him&mdash;in the
Shropshire dingle; he meets his Irish friend Murtagh at
Horncastle, at the same fair; and in the person of Jack Dale, he
meets the pseudo-Quaker&rsquo;s son, who many years ago had
robbed the old Chinese scholar from whom Borrow had just
parted.</p>

the Romani is evidently Borrow&rsquo;s own, and does not admit of

piece may be translated:</p>

in a letter to Murray, dated Nov. 11, 1852, in which Borrow
expresses his intention of &lsquo;adding some notes&rsquo; to the
present work.&nbsp; The result is this extraordinary
&lsquo;Malebolgia,&rsquo; as Professor Knapp terms it, into which
Borrow has thrust all those who had incurred his ill-will, even
for the most trivial of reasons.&nbsp; His enmity with Rome dates
from his Spanish experiences as colporteur of the Bible Society
in 1838 and 1839.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. Flamson&rsquo; is placed in
the pillory, because he had offended Borrow by carrying a railway
line through his Oulton grounds; and Scott, apparently for no
better reason than his neglect to acknowledge a presentation copy
of the &lsquo;Romantic Ballads.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo; experiences Borrow&rsquo;s
resentment because he did not see his way to making
&lsquo;Lavengro&rsquo; a magistrate; and the &lsquo;Old
Radical&rsquo; is gibbeted because he obtained an official
position which Borrow desired for himself.</p>

synonymous with Gentile and Gentoo; if so, the manner in which it
has been applied for ages ceases to surprise, for genteel is
heathenish.&nbsp; Ideas of barbaric pearl and gold, glittering
armour, plumes, tortures, blood-shedding, and lust, should always
be connected with it.&nbsp; Wace, in his grand Norman poem, calls
the Baron genteel:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;La furent li gentil Baron,&rsquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he certainly could not have applied the word better than
to the strong Norman thief, aimed cap-&agrave;-pie, without one
particle of ruth or generosity; for a person to be a pink of
gentility, that is heathenism, should have no such feelings; and,
indeed, the admirers of gentility seldom or never associate any
such feelings with it.&nbsp; It was from the Norman, the worst of
all robbers and miscreants, who built strong castles, garrisoned
them with devils, and tore out poor wretches&rsquo; eyes, as the
Saxon Chronicle says, that the English got their detestable word
genteel.&nbsp; What could ever have made the English such
admirers of gentility, it would be difficult to say; for, during
three hundred years, they suffered enough by it.&nbsp; Their
genteel Norman landlords were their scourgers, their torturers,
the plunderers of their homes, the dishonourers of their wives,
and the deflowerers of their daughters.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all,
fear is at the root of the English veneration for gentility.

derived from the same root as genteel; but nothing can be more
distinct from the mere genteel, than the ideas which enlightened
minds associate with these words.&nbsp; Gentle and gentlemanly
mean something kind and genial; genteel, that which is glittering
or gaudy.&nbsp; A person can be a gentleman in rags, but nobody
can be genteel. (G.B.)</p>

out in the midst of a vehement political contest, people may be
led to suppose that the above was written expressly for the
time.&nbsp; The writer, therefore, begs to state that it was
written in the year 1854.&nbsp; He cannot help adding that he is
neither Whig, Tory, nor Radical, and cares not a straw what party
governs England, provided it is governed well.&nbsp; But he has
no hopes of good government from the Whigs.&nbsp; It is true that
amongst them there is one very great man, Lord Palmerston, who is
indeed the sword and buckler, the chariots and the horses of the
party; but it is impossible for his lordship to govern well with
such colleagues as he has&mdash;colleagues which have been forced
upon him by family influence, and who are continually pestering
him into measures anything but conducive to the country&rsquo;s
honour and interest.&nbsp; If Palmerston would govern well, he
must get rid of them; but from that step, with all his courage
and all his greatness, he will shrink.&nbsp; Yet how proper and
easy a step it would be!&nbsp; He could easily get better, but
scarcely worse, associates.&nbsp; They appear to have one object
in view, and only one&mdash;jobbery.&nbsp; It was chiefly owing
to a most flagitious piece of jobbery, which one of his
lordship&rsquo;s principal colleagues sanctioned and promoted,
that his lordship experienced his late parliamentary disasters

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
